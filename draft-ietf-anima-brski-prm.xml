<?line 128?>

<t>This document defines enhancements to Bootstrapping a Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC8995) to enable bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar.
It specifically changes the interaction model from a pledge-initiated mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge-responding mode, where the pledge is in server role.
For this, BRSKI with Pledge in Responder Mode (BRSKI-PRM) introduces a new component, the registrar-agent, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase.
To establish the trust relation between pledge and registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on object security rather than transport security.
The approach defined here is agnostic to the enrollment protocol that connects the domain registrar to the domain CA.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>BRSKI as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> specifies a solution for secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrapping of devices (pledges) in a (customer) site domain.
This includes the discovery of the BRSKI registrar in the customer site/domain and the exchange of security information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the domain.</t>

<t>Security information about the customer site/domain, specifically the customer site/domain certificate, are exchanged and authenticated utilizing voucher-request and voucher-response artifacts as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Vouchers are signed objects from the Manufacturer's Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).
The MASA issues the voucher and provides it via the domain registrar to the pledge.
<xref target="RFC8366"/> specifies the format of the voucher artifacts.
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-rfc8366bis"/> further enhances the format of the voucher artifacts and also the voucher-request.</t>

<t>For the certificate enrollment of devices, BRSKI relies on EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> to request and distribute customer site/domain specific device certificates.
EST in turn relies for the authentication and authorization of the certification request on the credentials used by the underlying TLS between the EST client and the EST server.</t>

<t>BRSKI addresses scenarios in which the pledge initiates the bootstrapping acting as client (referred to as initiator mode by this document).
BRSKI with pledge in responder mode (BRSKI-PRM) defined in this document allows the pledge to act as server, so that it can be triggered to generate bootstrapping requests in the customer site/domain.
For this approach, this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>introduces the registrar-agent as new component to facilitate the communication between the pledge and the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent may be implemented as an integrated functionality of a commissioning tool or be co-located with the registrar itself.
BRSKI-PRM supports the identification of the registrar-agent that was performing the bootstrapping allowing for accountability of the pledges installation, when the registrar-agent is a component used by an installer and not co-located with the registrar.</t>
  <t>specifies the interaction (data exchange and data objects) between a pledge acting as server, the registrar-agent acting as client, and the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>enables the usage of arbitrary transports between the pledge and the domain registrar via the registrar-agent; security is addressed at the application layer, and both IP-based and non-IP connectivity can be used between pledge and registrar-agent.</t>
  <t>allows the application of registrar-agent credentials to establish TLS connections to the domain registrar; these are different from the IDevID of the pledge.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The term endpoint used in the context of this document is equivalent to resource in HTTP <xref target="RFC9110"/> and CoAP <xref target="RFC7252"/>; it is not used to describe a device.
Endpoints are accessible via Well-Known URIs <xref target="RFC8615"/>.
For the interaction with the domain registrar, the registrar-agent will use existing BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> endpoints as well as additional endpoints defined in this document.
To utilize the EST server endpoints on the domain registrar, the registrar-agent will act as client toward the registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent also acts as a client when communicating with a pledge in responder mode.
Here, TLS with server-side, certificate-based authentication is only optionally supported.
If TLS is optionally used between the registrar-agent and the pledge, the registrar-agent needs to identify the pledge based on its product serial number rather than the hostname as this is not set in an IDevID certificate.</t>

<t>BRSKI-PRM is designed to rely on object security to support also for alternative transports for which TLS may not be available, e.g., Bluetooth or NFC.
This is achieved through an additional signature wrapping of the exchanged data objects involving the registrar-agent for transport.</t>

<t>To utilize EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> for enrollment, the domain registrar must perform the pre-processing of this wrapping signature before actually using EST as defined in <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>

<t>There may be pledges which can support both modes, initiator and responder mode.
In these cases BRSKI-PRM can be combined with BRSKI as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> or BRSKI-AE <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-brski-ae"/> to allow for more bootstrapping flexibility.</t>

<t>This document includes many examples that would contain many long sequences of base64 encoded objects with no content directly comprehensible to a human reader.
In order to keep those examples short, they use the token "base64encodedvalue==" as a placeholder for base64 data.
The full base64 data is included in the appendices of this document.</t>

<t>This protocol unavoidably has a mix of both base64 encoded data (as is normal for many JSON encoded protocols), and also BASE64URL encoded data, as specified by JWS.
The latter is indicated by a string like "BASE64URL(content-name)".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope-of-solution"><name>Scope of Solution</name>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Environments and Use Case Examples</name>

<t>BRSKI-PRM is applicable to scenarios where pledges may have no direct connection to the domain registrar, may have no continuous connection, or require coordination of the pledge requests to be provided to a domain registrar.</t>

<t>This can be motivated by pledges deployed in environments not yet connected to the operational customer site/domain network, e.g., at a building construction site, or environments intentionally disconnected from the Internet, e.g., critical industrial facilities.
Another example is the assembly of electrical cabinets, which are prepared in advance before the installation at a customer site/domain.</t>

<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation a typical use case exists where a detached building or the basement is equipped with sensors, actuators, and controllers, but with only limited or no connection to the central building management system.
This limited connectivity may exist during installation time or also during operation time.</t>

<t>During the installation, for instance, a service technician collects the device-specific information from the basement network and provides them to the central building management system.
This could be done using a laptop, common mobile device, or dedicated commissioning tool to transport the information.
The service technician may successively collect device-specific information in different parts of the building before connecting to the domain registrar for bulk bootstrapping.</t>

<t>A domain registrar may be part of the central building management system and already be operational in the installation network.
The central building management system can then provide operational parameters for the specific devices in the basement or other detached areas.
These operational parameters may comprise values and settings required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, among them a certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other components and services.
These operational parameters are then provided to the devices in the basement facilitated by the service technician's laptop.
The registrar-agent, defined in this document, may be run on the technician's laptop to interact with pledges.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which the network infrastructure is normally isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for security reasons.
In such a case, limited access to a domain registrar may be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of time, for example when a batch of new devices are deployed, but prohibited at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="less-operational-security-in-the-target-domain"><name>Less Operational Security in the Target-Domain</name>

<t>The registration authority (RA) performing the authorization of a certificate request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher operational security than other components utilizing the issued certificates.
CAs may also require higher security in the registration procedures.
There may be situations in which the customer site/domain does not offer enough physical security to operate a RA/CA and therefore this service is transferred to a backend that offers a higher level of operational security.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="limitations"><name>Limitations</name>

<t>The mechanism described in this document presumes the availability of the pledge and the registrar-agent to communicate with another.
This may not be possible in constrained environments where, in particular, power must be conserved.
In these situations, it is anticipated that the transceiver will be powered down most of the time.
This presents a rendezvous problem: the pledge is unavailable for certain periods of time, and the registrar-agent is similarly presumed to be unavailable for certain periods of time.
To overcome this situation, the pledges may need to be powered on, either manually or by sending a trigger signal.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirements Discussion and Mapping to Solution-Elements</name>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/>, the following requirements are derived to support bootstrapping of pledges in responder mode (acting as server):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>To facilitate the communication between a pledge in responder mode and the registrar, additional functionality is needed either on the registrar or as a stand-alone component.
This new functionality is defined as registrar-agent and acts as an agent of the registrar to trigger the pledge to generate requests for voucher and enrollment.
These requests are then provided by the registrar-agent to the registrar.
This requires the definition of pledge endpoints to allow interaction with the registrar-agent.</t>
  <t>The security of communication between the registrar-agent and the pledge must not rely on Transport Layer Security (TLS) to enable application of BRSKI-PRM in environments, in which the communication between the registrar-agent and the pledge is done over other technologies like BTLE or NFC, which may not support TLS protected communication.
In addition, the pledge does not have a certificate that can easily be verified by <xref target="RFC6125"/> methods.</t>
  <t>The use of authenticated self-contained objects addresses both, the TLS challenges and the technology stack challenge.</t>
  <t>By contrast, the registrar-agent can be authenticated by the registrar as a component, acting on behalf of the registrar.
In addition the registrar must be able to verify, which registrar-agent was in direct contact with the pledge.</t>
  <t>It would be inaccurate for the voucher-request and voucher-response to use an assertion with value "proximity" in the voucher, as the pledge was not in direct contact with the registrar for bootstrapping.
Therefore, a new "agent-proximity" assertion value is necessary for distinguishing assertions the MASA can state.</t>
</list></t>

<t>At least the following properties are required for the voucher and enrollment processing:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>POI: provides data-origin authentication of a data object, e.g., a voucher-request or an enrollment-request, utilizing an existing IDevID.
Certificate updates may utilize the certificate that is to be updated.</t>
  <t>POP: proves that an entity possesses and controls the private key corresponding to the public key contained in the certification request, typically by adding a signature computed using the private key to the certification request.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Solution examples based on existing technology are provided with the focus on existing IETF RFCs:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Voucher-requests and -responses as used in <xref target="RFC8995"/> already provide both, POP and POI, through a digital signature to protect the integrity of the voucher, while the corresponding signing certificate contains the identity of the signer.</t>
  <t>Certification requests are data structures containing the information from a requester for a CA to create a certificate.
The certification request format in BRSKI is PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>.
In PKCS#10, the structure is signed to ensure integrity protection and POP of the private key of the requester that corresponds to the contained public key.
In the application examples, this POP alone is not sufficient.
A POI is also required for the certification request and therefore the certification request needs to be additionally bound to the existing credential of the pledge (IDevID).
This binding supports the authorization decision for the certification request and may be provided directly with the certification request.
While BRSKI uses the binding to TLS, BRSKI-PRM aims at an additional signature of the PKCS#10 using existing credentials on the pledge (IDevID). This allows the process to be independent of the selected transport.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architectural Overview</name>

<t>For BRSKI with pledge in responder mode, the base system architecture defined in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is enhanced to facilitate new use cases in which the pledge acts as server.
The responder mode allows delegated bootstrapping using a registrar-agent instead of a direct connection between the pledge and the domain registrar.</t>

<t>Necessary enhancements to support authenticated self-contained objects for certificate enrollment are kept at a minimum to enable reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.
The format of the bootstrapping objects produced or consumed by the pledge is based on JOSE <xref target="RFC7515"/> and further specified in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/> to address the requirements stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> above.
In constrained environments it may be provided based on COSE <xref target="RFC9052"/> and <xref target="RFC9053"/>.</t>

<t>An abstract overview of the BRSKI-PRM protocol can be found on slide 8 of <xref target="BRSKI-PRM-abstract"/>.</t>

<t>To support mutual trust establishment between the domain registrar and pledges not directly connected to the customer site/domain, this document specifies the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects with the help of a registrar-agent.</t>

<t>This leads to extensions of the logical components in the BRSKI architecture as shown in <xref target="uc2figure"/>.</t>

<t>Note that the Join Proxy is not shown in the figure, having been replaced by the Registrar Agent.
The Join Proxy may still be present, and there <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be some situations in which the Join Proxy can be used by the Registrar-Agent to connect to the Registrar.
For example, the Registrar-Agent application on a smartphone often can connect to local wifi without giving up their LTE connection <xref target="androidnsd"/>, but only can make link-local connections.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent interacts with the pledge to transfer the required data objects for bootstrapping, which are then also exchanged between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
The addition of the registrar-agent influences the sequences of the data exchange between the pledge and the domain registrar described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
To enable reuse of BRSKI defined functionality as much as possible, BRSKI-PRM:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>uses existing endpoints where the required functionality is provided.</t>
  <t>enhances existing endpoints with new supported media types, e.g., for JWS voucher.</t>
  <t>defines new endpoints where additional functionality is required, e.g., for wrapped certification request, CA certificates, or new status information.</t>

<t><xref target="uc2figure"/> shows the relations between the following main components:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pledge: The pledge is expected to respond with the necessary data objects for bootstrapping to the registrar-agent.
The protocol used between the pledge and the registrar-agent is assumed to be HTTP in the context of this document.
Any other protocols (including HTTPS) can be used as long as they support the exchange of the necessary data objects.
This includes CoAP or protocol to be used over Bluetooth or NFC connections
A pledge acting as a server during bootstrapping leads to some differences for BRSKI:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Discovery of the pledge by the registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be possible.</t>
      <t>As the registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to request data objects for bootstrapping of the pledge, the pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> offer corresponding endpoints as defined in <xref target="pledge_ep"/>.</t>
      <t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide additional data to the pledge in the context of the voucher-request trigger, which the pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include into the PVR as defined in <xref target="pvrt"/> and <xref target="pvrr"/>.
This allows the registrar to identify, with which registrar-agent the pledge was in contact.</t>
      <t>The order of exchanges in the BRSKI-PRM call flow is different those in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>, as the PVR and PER are collected at once and provided to the registrar.
This enables bulk bootstrapping of several devices.</t>
      <t>The data objects utilized for the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar are self-contained authenticated objects (signature-wrapped objects).</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Registrar-agent: provides a store and forward communication path to exchange data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent brokers in situations in which the domain registrar is not directly reachable by the pledge.
This may be due to a different technology stack or due to missing connectivity.
The registrar-agent triggers a pledge to create bootstrapping artifacts such as the voucher-request and the enrollment-request on one or multiple pledges.
It can then perform a (bulk) bootstrapping based on the collected data.
The registrar-agent is expected to possess information about the domain registrar: the registrar LDevID certificate, LDevID(CA) certificate, IP address, either by configuration or by using the discovery mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
There is no trust assumption between the pledge and the registrar-agent as only authenticated self-contained objects are used, which are transported via the registrar-agent and provided either by the pledge or the registrar.
The trust assumption between the registrar-agent and the registrar is based on the LDevID of the registrar-agent, provided by the PKI responsible for the domain.
This allows the registrar-agent to authenticate towards the registrar, e.g., in a TLS handshake.
Based on this, the registrar is able to distinguish a pledge from a registrar-agent during the TLS session establishment and also to verify that this registrar-agent is authorized to perform the bootstrapping of the distinct pledge.</t>
  <t>Join Proxy (not shown): same functionality as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/> if needed.
Note that a registrar-agent may use a join proxy to facilitate the TLS connection to the registrar, in the same way that a BRSKI pledge would use a join proxy. This is useful in cases where the registrar-agent does not have full IP connectivity via the domain network, or cases where it has no other means to locate the registrar on the network.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar: In general, the domain registrar fulfills the same functionality regarding the bootstrapping of the pledge in a (customer) site domain by facilitating the communication of the pledge with the MASA service and the domain PKI service.
In contrast to <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the domain registrar does not interact with a pledge directly but through the registrar-agent.
A registrar with combined functionality of BRSKI and BRSKI-PRM detects if the bootstrapping is performed by the pledge directly (BRSKI case) or by the registrar-agent (BRSKI-PRM case) based on the utilized credential for authentication (either pledge’s IDevID or LDevID from registrar-agent), see also <xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>
  <t>The manufacturer provided components/services (MASA and Ownership tracker) are used as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
A MASA is able to support enrollment via registrar-agent without changes unless it checks the vouchers proximity indication, in which case it would need to be enhanced to support BRSKI-PRM to also accept the agent-proximity.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="agt_prx"><name>Agent-Proximity Assertion</name>

<t>"Agent-proximity" is a statement in the PVR and in the voucher, that the registrar certificate was provided via the registrar-agent as defined in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/> and not directly to the pledge.
"Agent-proximity" is therefore a weaker assertion then "proximity", which is defined in section 4 of <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
"agent-proximity" is defined as additional assertion type in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-rfc8366bis"/>.
This can be verified by the registrar and also by the MASA during the voucher-request processing.</t>

<t>In BRSKI, the pledge verifies POP of the registrar via the TLS handshake and pins that public key as the "proximity-registrar-cert" into the voucher request.
This allows the MASA to see the proximity of the pledge and registrar, facilitating a decision to assign the pledge to that domain owner.
In BRSKI, the TLS connection is considered provisional until the pledge receives the voucher.</t>

<t>In contrast, in BRSKI-PRM, the pledge has no direct connection to the registrar and must take the Registrar-Agent LDevID provisionally.
The registrar-agent has included its LDevID, a certificate signed by the domain owner, into the PVR trigger message.
The registrar-agent identity is therefore included into the Pledge Voucher Request (PVR).</t>

<t>Akin to the BRSKI case, the pledge has provided proximity evidence to the MASA.
But additionally, this allows the Registrar to be sure that the PVR collected by the Registrar-Agent was in fact collected by the Registrar-Agent to which the Registrar is connected to.</t>

<t>In a similar fashion, the pledge accepts the registrar certificate provisionally until it receives the voucher as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_3"/>.
See also Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8995"/> on "PROVISIONAL accept of server cert".</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge_ep"><name>Behavior of Pledge in Pledge-Responder-Mode</name>

<t>The pledge is triggered by the registrar-agent to generate the PVR and PER.
It will also be triggered for processing of the responses and the generation of status information once the registrar-agent has received the responses from the registrar later in the process.
Due to the use of the registrar-agent, the interaction with the domain registrar is changed as shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_1"/>.
To enable interaction as responder with the registrar-agent, the pledge provides endpoints using the BRSKI defined endpoints based on the "/.well-known/brski" URI tree.</t>

<t>The following endpoints are defined for the <em>pledge</em> in this document.
The endpoints are defined with short names to also accommodate for the constraint case.
The URI path begins with "http://pledge.example/.well-known/brski" followed by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation.</t>

<t>Operations and their corresponding URIs:</t>

<texttable title="Endpoints on the pledge" anchor="eppfigure1">

</texttable>

</section>
<section anchor="behavior-of-registrar-agent"><name>Behavior of Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The registrar-agent as a new component provides a message passing service between the pledge and the domain registrar.
It facilitates the exchange of data between the pledge and the domain registrar, which are the voucher-request/response, the enrollment-request/response, as well as related telemetry and status information.</t>

<t>For the communication with the pledge the registrar-agent utilizes communication endpoints provided by the pledge.
The transport in this specification is based on HTTP but may also be done using other transport mechanisms.</t>

<t>The communication between the registrar-agent and the pledge <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be protected using TLS as outlined in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/>.
The details of doing TLS validation are <xref target="pledgehttps"/>.</t>

<t>For the communication with the registrar, the registrar-agent uses the endpoints of the domain registrar side already specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/> (derived from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>) where suitable.
These endpoints do not expect signature wrapped-objects, which are used b BRSKI-PRM.
This specifically applies for the enrollment-request and the provisioning of CA certificates.
To accommodate the use of signature-wrapped object, the following additional endpoints are defined for the <em>registrar</em>.
Operations and their corresponding URIs:</t>

<texttable title="Additional endpoints on the registrar" anchor="eppfigure2">
      <ttcol align='left'>Operation</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Endpoint</ttcol>
      <ttcol align='left'>Details</ttcol>
      <c>Supply PER to registrar - Returns enrollment-response</c>
      <c>/requestenroll</c>
      <c><xref target="exchanges_uc2_2_per"/></c>
      <c>Request (wrapped) CA certificates - Returns wrapped CA Certificates</c>
      <c>/wrappedcacerts</c>
      <c><xref target="exchanges_uc2_2_wca"/></c>
</texttable>

<t>For authentication to the domain registrar, the registrar-agent uses its LDevID(RegAgt).
The provisioning of the registrar-agent LDevID is out of scope for this document, but may be done in advance using a separate BRSKI run or by other means like configuration.
It is recommended to use short lived registrar-agent LDevIDs in the range of days or weeks as outlined in <xref target="sec_cons_reg-agt"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent will use its LDevID(RegAgt) when establishing a TLS session with the domain registrar for TLS client authentication.
The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID), which is used as reference in the context of an agent-signed-data object as defined in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/>.
Note that this is an additional requirement for issuing the certificate, as <xref target="IEEE-802.1AR"/> only requires the SKID to be included for intermediate CA certificates.
<xref target="RFC8995"/> makes a similar requirement.
In BRSKI-PRM, the SKID is used in favor of providing the complete LDEVID(RegAgt) certificate to accommodate also constraint environments and reduce bandwidth needed for communication with the pledge.
In addition, it follows the recommendation from BRSKI to use SKID in favor of a certificate fingerprint to avoid additional computations.</t>

<t>Using an LDevID for TLS client authentication of the registrar-agent is a deviation from <xref target="RFC8995"/>, in which the pledge's IDevID credential is used to perform TLS client authentication.
The use of the LDevID(RegAgt) allows the domain registrar to distinguish, if bootstrapping is initiated from a pledge or from a registrar-agent and to adopt different internal handling accordingly.
If a registrar detects a request that originates from a registrar-agent it is able to switch the operational mode from BRSKI to BRSKI-PRM.
This may be supported by a specific naming in the SAN (subject alternative name) component of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.
Alternatively, the domain may feature a CA specifically for issuing registrar-agent LDevID certificates.
This allows the registrar to detect registrar-agents based on the issuing CA.</t>

<t>As BRSKI-PRM uses authenticated self-contained data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar, the binding of the pledge identity to the requests is provided by the data object signature employing the pledge's IDevID.
The objects exchanged between the pledge and the domain registrar used in the context of this specifications are JOSE objects.</t>

<t>In addition to the LDevID(RegAgt), the registrar-agent is provided with the product-serial-number(s) of the pledge(s) to be bootstrapped.
This is necessary to allow the discovery of pledge(s) by the registrar-agent using mDNS (see <xref target="discovery_uc2_ppa"/>)
The list may be provided by prior administrative means or the registrar agent may get the information via an interaction with the pledge.
For instance, <xref target="RFC9238"/> describes scanning of a QR code, the product-serial-number would be initialized from the 12N B005 Product Serial Number.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 5.3, the domain registrar performs the pledge authorization for bootstrapping within his domain based on the pledge voucher-request object.
This behavior is retained also in BRSKI-PRM.</t>

<t>The following information <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be available at the registrar-agent before interaction with a pledge:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>LDevID(RegAgt): own operational key pair (to sign agent-signed-data).</t>
  <t>Registrar LDevID certificate: certificate of the domain registrar (to be provided to the pledge).</t>
  <t>Serial-number(s): product-serial-number(s) of pledge(s) to be bootstrapped (to query discover specific pledges based on the serial number).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="discovery_uc2_reg"><name>Discovery of Registrar by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The discovery of the domain registrar may be done as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 4 with the
deviation that it is done between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
Alternatively, the registrar-agent may be configured with the address of the domain registrar and the certificate of the domain registrar.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery_uc2_ppa"><name>Discovery of Pledge by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The discovery of the pledge by registrar-agent should be done by using DNS-based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/> over Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> to discover the pledge.
The pledge constructs a local host name based on device local information (product-serial-number), which results in "product-serial-number._brski-pledge._tcp.local".
The product-serial-number composition is vendor dependent and may contain information regarding the vendor, the product type, and further information specific to the product instance. To allow distinction of pledges, the product-serial-number therfore needs to be sufficiently unique.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>"product-serial-number._brski-pledge._tcp.local", to discover a specific pledge, e.g., when connected to a local network.</t>
  <t>"_brski-pledge._tcp.local" to get a list of pledges to be bootstrapped.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A manufacturer may allow the pledge to react on mDNS discovery without his product-serial-number contained. This allows a commissioning tool to discover pledges to be bootstrapped in the domain. The manufacturer support this functionality as outlined in <xref target="sec_cons_mDNS"/>.</t>

<t>Establishing network connectivity of the pledge is out of scope of this document but necessary to apply mDNS.
For Ethernet it is provided by simply connecting the network cable.
For WiFi networks, connectivity can be provided by using a pre-agreed SSID for bootstrapping, e.g., as proposed in <xref target="I-D.richardson-emu-eap-onboarding"/>.
The same approach can be used by 6LoWPAN/mesh using a pre-agreed PAN ID.
How to gain network connectivity is out of scope of this document.</t>

<t>As an alternative discovery mechanism GRASP M_DISCOVERY multicast with M_RESPONSE, based on <xref target="RFC8990"/>, may be used.
The specification of this approach to discover a pledge from the registrar-agent is left for further study.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="behavior-of-pledge-with-combined-functionality"><name>Behavior of Pledge with Combined Functionality</name>

<t>Pledges <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> support both initiator or responder mode.</t>

<t>A pledge in initiator mode should listen for announcement messages as described in <xref section="4.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8995"/>.
Upon discovery of a potential registrar, it initiates the bootstrapping to that registrar.
At the same time (so as to avoid the Slowloris-attack described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>), it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also respond to the triggers for responder mode described in this document.</t>

<t>Once a pledge with combined functionality has been bootstrapped, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> act as client for enrollment of further certificates needed, e.g., using the enrollment protocol of choice.
If it still acts as server, the defined BRSKI-PRM endpoints to trigger a pledge enrollment-request (PER) or to provide an enrollment-response can be used for further certificates.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2"><name>Bootstrapping Data Objects and Corresponding Exchanges</name>

<t>The interaction of the pledge with the registrar-agent may be accomplished using different transport means (protocols and/or network technologies).
This specification utilizes HTTP as transport.
Alternative transport channels may be CoAP, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Nearfield Communication (NFC).
These transport means may differ from, and are independent of, the ones used between the registrar-agent and the registrar.
Transport channel independence is realized by data objects, which are not bound to specific transport security and stay the same across the communication from the pledge via the registrar-agent to the registrar..
Therefore, authenticated self-contained objects (here: signature-wrapped objects) are applied for data exchanges between the pledge and the registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent provides the domain registrar certificate (registrar LDevID certificate) to the pledge to be included in the PVR leaf "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate".
This enables the registrar to verify that it is the desired registrar for handling the request.</t>

<t>The registrar certificate may be configured at the registrar-agent or may be fetched by the registrar-agent based on a prior TLS connection with this domain registrar.
In addition, the registrar-agent provides agent-signed-data containing the pledge product-serial-number, signed with the LDevID(RegAgt), as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/>.
This enables the registrar to verify and log, which registrar-agent was in contact with the pledge, when verifying the PVR.</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate identified by the SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) in the header of the agent-signed-data from the PVR in its RVR (see also <contact fullname="pvr-proc-reg"/>.</t>

<t>The MASA in turn verifies the registrar LDevID certificate is included in the PVR (contained in the "prior-signed-voucher-request" field of RVR) in the "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate" leaf and may assert the PVR as "verified" or "logged".</t>

<t>In addition, the MASA can issue the assertion "agent-proximity" as follows:
The MASA can verify the signature of the agent-signed-data contained in the prior-signed-voucher-request, based on the provided LDevID(RegAgt) certificate in the "agent-sign-cert" leaf of the RVR.
If both can be verified successfully, the MASA can assert "agent-proximity" in the voucher.
This agent-proximity is similar to the proximity assertion by the MASA when using BRSKI.
It is a stronger assertion than "logged", but it is weaker than the assertion "verified", which relies on ownership tracking.</t>

<t>Depending on the MASA verification policy, it may also respond with a suitable 4xx or 5xx error status code as described in section 5.6 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
When successful, the voucher will then be supplied via the registrar to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t><xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_all"/> provides an overview of the exchanges detailed in the following sub sections.</t>

<t>The following sub sections split the interactions shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_all"/> between the different components into:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t><xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/> describes the request object acquisition by the registrar-agent from pledge.</t>

  <t><xref target="exchanges_uc2_5"/> describes the general status handling and addresses corresponding exchanges between the registrar-agent and the registrar.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_1"><name>Request Objects Acquisition by Registrar-Agent from Pledge</name>

<t>The following description assumes that the registrar-agent has already discovered the pledge.
This may be done as described in <xref target="discovery_uc2_ppa"/> and <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_all"/> based on DNS-SD or similar.</t>

<t>The focus is on the exchange of signature-wrapped objects using endpoints defined for the pledge in <xref target="pledge_ep"/>.</t>

<t>Preconditions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pledge: possesses IDevID</t>
  <t>Registrar-agent:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t><bcp14>MAY</bcp14> handle/trusts pledges IDevID CA certificate to validate IDevID certificate on returned PVR or in case of TLS usage for pledge communication.
The distribution of IDevID CA certificates to the registrar-agent is out of scope of this document and may be done by a manual configuration.</t>
      <t>possesses own LDevID(RegAgt) credentials for the registrar domain (site).
In addition, the registrar-agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> know the product-serial-number(s) of the pledge(s) to be bootstrapped.
The registrar-agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be provided with the product-serial-number(s) in different ways:
      <list style="symbols">
          <t>configured, e.g., as a list of pledges to be bootstrapped via QR code scanning</t>
          <t>discovered by using standard approaches like mDNS as described in <xref target="discovery_uc2_ppa"/></t>
          <t>discovered by using a vendor specific approach, e.g., RF beacons.
If the serial numbers are not known in advance, the registrar-agent cannot perform a distinct triggering of pledges but and triggers  all pledges discovered .</t>
        </list></t>
    </list>
The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have synchronized time.</t>
  <t>Registrar (same as in BRSKI): possesses/trusts IDevID CA certificate and has own registrar LDevID credentials.</t>
</list></t>

<t>TLS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be optionally used to provide privacy for the interaction between the registrar-agent and the pledge, see <xref target="pledgehttps"/>.</t>

<t>Note: The registrar-agent may trigger the pledge for the PVR or the PER or both. It is expected that this will be aligned with a service technician workflow, visiting and installing each pledge.</t>

<section anchor="pvrt"><name>Pledge-Voucher-Request (PVR) - Trigger</name>

<t>Triggering the pledge to create the PVR is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/tpvr"</t>

<t>The registrar-agent PVR trigger Content-Type header is: <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>.
Following parameters are provided in the JSON object:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: base64-encoded registrar EE TLS certificate.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: base64-encoded JSON-in-JWS object.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The trigger for the pledge to create a PVR is depicted in the following figure:</t>

<figure title="Representation of trigger to create PVR" anchor="pavrt"><artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
{
  "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
  "agent-signed-data": "base64encodedvalue=="
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Note that at the time of receiving the PVR trigger, the pledge cannot verify the registrar LDevID certificate and has no proof-of-possession of the corresponding private key for the certificate. The pledge therefore accepts the registrar LDevID certificate provisionally until it receives the voucher as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_3"/>.</t>

<t>The pledge will also be unable to verify the agent-signed-data itself as it does not possess the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate and the domain trust has not been established at this point of the communication.
Verification <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be done, after the voucher has been received.</t>

<t>The agent-signed-data is a JSON-in-JWS object and contains the following information:</t>

<t>The header of the agent-signed-data contains:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.</t>
  <t>kid: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the base64-encoded bytes of the SubjectKeyIdentifier (the "KeyIdentifier" OCTET STRING value) of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the voucher-request trigger, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> construct the body of the PVR as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
It will contain additional information provided by the registrar-agent as specified in the following.
This PVR becomes a JSON-in-JWS object as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.
If the pledge is unable to construct the PVR it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with a HTTP error code to the registrar-agent to indicate that it is not able to create the PVR.</t>

<t>The following client error responses <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>400 Bad Request: if the pledge detected an error in the format of the request, e.g. missing field, wrong data types, etc. or if the request is not valid JSON even though the PVR media type was set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>.</t>
  <t>403 Forbidden: if the pledge detected that one or more security parameters from the trigger message to create the PVR were not valid, e.g., the LDevID (Reg) certificate.</t>

<t>The PVR Media-Type is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> as <spanx style="verb">application/voucher-jws+json</spanx>.</t>

<t>The pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include this Media-Type header field indicating the included media type for the PVR.
The PVR is included by the registrar in its RCR as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-enrollment-request-per-trigger"><name>Pledge-Enrollment-Request (PER) - Trigger</name>

<t>Once the registrar-agent has received the PVR it can trigger the pledge to generate a PER.
As in BRSKI the PER contains a PKCS#10, but additionally signed using the pledge's IDevID.
Note, as the initial enrollment aims to request a generic certificate, no certificate attributes are provided to the pledge.</t>

<t>Triggering the pledge to create the enrollment-request is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/tper"</t>

<t>The registrar-agent PER trigger Content-Type header is: <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx> with an empty body by default.
Note that using HTTP POST allows for an empty body, but also to provide additional data, like CSR attributes or information about the enroll type "enroll-generic-cert" or "re-enroll-generic-cert".
The "enroll-generic-cert" case is shown in <xref target="raer"/>.</t>

<figure title="Example of trigger to create a PER" anchor="raer"><artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
{
  "enroll-type" : "enroll-generic-cert"
}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This document specifies the request of a generic certificate with no CSR attributes provided to the pledge.
If specific attributes in the certificate are required, they have to be inserted by the issuing RA/CA.
How the HTTP POST can be used to provide CSR attributes is out of scope for this specification.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="PER-response"><name>Pledge-Enrollment-Request (PER) - Response</name>

<t>In the following the enrollment is described as initial enrollment with an empty HTTP POST body.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the PER  trigger, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> construct the PER as authenticated self-contained object.
The CSR already assures POP of the private key corresponding to the contained public key.
In addition, based on the PER signature using the IDevID, POI is provided.
Here, a JOSE object is being created in which the body utilizes the YANG module ietf-ztp-types with the grouping for csr-grouping for the CSR as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/>.</t>

<t>Depending on the capability of the pledge, it constructs the pledge enrollment-request (PER) as plain PKCS#10.
Note, the focus in this use case is placed on PKCS#10 as PKCS#10 can be transmitted in different enrollment protocols in the infrastructure like EST, CMP, CMS, and SCEP.
If the pledge has already implemented an enrollment protocol, it may leverage that functionality for the creation of the CSR.
Note, <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> also allows for inclusion of certification requests in different formats used by CMP or CMC.</t>

<t>The pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> construct the PER as PKCS#10.
In BRSKI-PRM it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> sign it additionally with its IDevID credentials to provide proof-of-identity bound to the PKCS#10 as described below.</t>

<t>If the pledge is unable to construct the PER it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with a HTTP 4xx/5xx error code to the registrar-agent to indicate that it is not able to create the PER.</t>

<t>The following 4xx client error codes <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>400 Bad Request: if the pledge detected an error in the format of the request or detected invalid JSON even though the PER media type was set to <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>.</t>
  <t>403 Forbidden: if the pledge detected that one or more security parameters (if provided) from the trigger message to create the PER are not valid.</t>
  <t>406 Not Acceptable: if the request's Accept header indicates a type that is unknown or unsupported. For example, a type other than <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx>.</t>
  <t>415 Unsupported Media Type: if the request's Content-Type header indicates a type that is unknown or unsupported. For example, a type other than 'application/json'.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A successful enrollment will result in a generic LDevID certificate for the pledge in the new domain, which can be used to request further (application specific) LDevID certificates if necessary for operation.
The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use the endpoints specified in this document.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> considers PKCS#10 but also CMP and CMC as certification request format.
Note that the wrapping of the PER signature is only necessary for plain PKCS#10 as other request formats like CMP and CMS support the signature wrapping as part of their own certificate request format.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent enrollment-request Content-Type header for a signature-wrapped PKCS#10 is: <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx></t>

<t>The header of the pledge enrollment-request <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain the following parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.</t>
  <t>x5c: contains the base64-encoded pledge IDevID certificate.
It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> optionally contain the certificate chain for this certificate. If the certificate chain is not included it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be available at the registrar for verification of the IDevID certificate.
The body of the pledge enrollment-request <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain a P10 parameter (for PKCS#10) as defined for ietf-ztp-types:p10-csr in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/>:</t>
  <t>P10: contains the base64-encoded PKCS#10 of the pledge.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The JOSE object is signed using the pledge's IDevID credential, which corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.</t>

<t>While BRSKI-PRM targets the initial enrollment, re-enrollment <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be supported as described in a similar way as for enrollment in this document, if no other re-enrollment mechanism is supported.
Note that in this case the current LDevID credential is used instead of the IDevID credential to create the signature of the PKCS#10 request.</t>

<t>With the collected PVR and PER, the registrar-agent starts the interaction with the domain registrar.</t>

<t>The new protected header field "created-on" is introduced to reflect freshness of the PER.
The field is marked critical "crit" to ensure that it must be understood and validated by the receiver (here the domain registrar) according to section 4.1.11 of <xref target="RFC7515"/>.
It allows the registrar to verify the timely correlation between the PER and previously exchanged messages, i.e., created-on of PER &gt;= created-on of PVR &gt;= created-on of PVR trigger.
The registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> consider to ignore any but the newest PER from the same pledge in the case the registrar has at any point in time more than one pending PER from the pledge.</t>

<t>As the registrar-agent is intended to facilitate communication between the pledge and the domain registrar, a collection of requests from more than one pledge is possible.
This allows bulk bootstrapping of several pledges using the same connection between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent establishes a TLS connection to the registrar.
As already stated in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the use of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged.
TLS 1.2 or newer is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> on the registrar-agent side.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be available on the registrar, but TLS 1.2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be available on the MASA, but TLS 1.2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.</t>

<section anchor="connection-establishment-registrar-agent-to-registrar"><name>Connection Establishment (Registrar-Agent to Registrar)</name>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> TLS client authentication to the registrar is achieved by using registrar-agent LDevID(RegAgt) credentials instead of pledge IDevID credentials.
Consequently BRSKI (pledge-initiator-mode) is distinguishable from BRSKI-PRM (pledge-responder-mode) by the registrar.
The registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> verify that the registrar-agent is authorized to establish a connection to the registrar by TLS client authentication using LDevID(RegAgt) credentials.
If the connection from registrar-agent to registrar is established, the authorization <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be verified again based on agent-signed-data contained in the PVR.
This ensures that the pledge has been triggered by an authorized registrar-agent.</t>

<t>With BRSKI-PRM, the pledge generates PVR and PER as JSON-in-JWS objects and the registrar agent forwards them to the registrar.
In <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the pledge generates PVR as CMS-signed JSON and PER as PKCS#10 or PKCS#7 according to <xref target="RFC7030"/> and inherited by <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>For BRSKI-PRM, the registrar agent sends the PVR by HTTP POST to the same registrar endpoint as introduced by BRSKI: "/.well-
known/brski/requestvoucher", but with a Content-Type header field for JSON-in-JWS"</t>

<t>The Content-Type header field for JSON-in-JWS PVR is: <spanx style="verb">application/voucher-jws+json</spanx> (see <xref target="pvr"/> for the content definition), as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sets the Accept field in the request-header indicating the acceptable Content-Type for the voucher-response.
The voucher-response Content-Type header field is set to <spanx style="verb">application/voucher-jws+json</spanx> as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pvr-proc-reg"><name>Pledge-Voucher-Request (PVR) Processing by Registrar</name>

<t>After receiving the PVR from registrar-agent, the registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> perform the verification as defined in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In addition, the registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> verify the following parameters from the PVR:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain registrar's own registrar LDevID certificate to ensure the registrar in proximity of the registrar-agent is the desired registrar for this PVR.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the agent provided data has been signed with the LDevID(RegAgt) credentials indicated in the "kid" JOSE header parameter.
The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the LDevID(ReAgt) certificate, corresponding to the signature, is still valid.
If the certificate is already expired, the registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> reject the request.
Validity of used signing certificates at the time of signing the agent-signed-data is necessary to avoid that a rogue registrar-agent generates agent-signed-data objects to onboard arbitrary pledges at a later point in time, see also <xref target="sec_cons_reg-agt"/>.
The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fetch the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate, based on the provided SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) contained in the "kid" header parameter of the agent-signed-data, and perform this verification.
This requires, that the registrar has access to the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data (including intermediate CA certificates if existent) based on the SKID.
Note, the registrar may have stored the LDevID(RegAgt) if used during TLS establishment between registrar-agent and registrar or it may be provided via a repository.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If the registrar is unable to validate the PVR it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with a HTTP 4xx/5xx error code to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t>The following 4xx client error codes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>403 Forbidden: if the registrar detected that one or more security related parameters are not valid.</t>

  <t>406 Not Acceptable: if the Content-Type indicated by the Accept header is unknown or unsupported.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If the validation succeeds, the registrar performs pledge authorization according to <xref target="RFC8995"/>, Section 5.3 followed by obtaining a voucher from the pledge's MASA according to <xref target="RFC8995"/>, Section 5.4 with the modifications described below in <xref target="rvr-proc"/>.</t>

The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> add an additional signature to the MASA provided voucher using its registrar credentials.</t>

<t>The signature is created by signing the original "JWS Payload" produced by MASA and the registrar added "JWS Protected Header" using the registrar LDevID credentials (see <xref target="RFC7515"/>, Section 5.2 point 8.
The x5c component of the "JWS Protected Header" <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the registrar LDevID certificate as well as potential intermediate CA certificates up to the pinned domain certificate.
The pinned domain certificate is already contained in the voucher payload ("pinned-domain-cert").</t>

<t>This signature provides POP of the private key corresponding to the registrar LDevID certificate the pledge received in the trigger for the PVR (see <xref target="pavrt"/>).
The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the same registrar LDevID credentials used for authentication in the TLS handshake to authenticate towards the registrar-agent.

<t>Depending on the security policy of the operator, this signature can also be interpreted by the pledge as explicit authorization of the registrar to install the contained trust anchor.

</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_2_per"><name>Pledge-Enrollment-Request (PER) Processing (Registrar-Agent to Registrar)</name>

<t>After receiving the voucher, the registrar-agent sends the PER to the registrar in the same HTTP-over-TLS connection. Which is similar to the PER processing described in Section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In case the PER cannot be send in the same HTTP-over-TLS connection the registrar-agent may send the PER in a new HTTP-over-TLS connection. The registrar is able to correlate the PVR and the PER based on the signatures and the contained product-serial-number information.
Note, this also addresses situations in which a nonceless voucher is used and may be pre-provisioned to the pledge.
As specified in <xref target="PER-response"/> deviating from BRSKI the PER is not a raw PKCS#10.
As the registrar-agent is involved in the exchange, the PKCS#10 is wrapped in a JWS object by the pledge and signed with pledge's IDevID to ensure proof-of-identity as outlined in <xref target="per"/>.</t>

<t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> standard endpoints (/simpleenroll, /simplereenroll, /serverkeygen, /cacerts) on the registrar cannot be used for BRSKI-PRM.
This is caused by the utilization of signature wrapped-objects in BRSKI-PRM.
As EST requires to sent a raw PKCS#10 request to e.g., "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll" endpoint, this document makes an enhancement by utilizing EST but with the exception to transport a signature wrapped PKCS#10 request.
Therefore a new endpoint for BRSKI-PRM on the registrar is defined as "/.well-known/brski/requestenroll"</t>

<t>The Content-Type header of PER is: <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx>.</t>

<t>This is a deviation from the Content-Type header values used in <xref target="RFC7030"/> and results in additional processing at the domain registrar (as EST server).
Note, the registrar is already aware that the bootstrapping is performed in a pledge-responder-mode due to the use of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate for TLS and the provided PVR as JSON-in-JWS object.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If the registrar receives a PER with Content-Type header: <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx>, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify the wrapping signature using the certificate indicated in the JOSE header.</t>
  <t>The registrar verifies that the pledge's certificate (here IDevID), carried in "x5c" header field, is accepted to join the domain after successful validation of the PVR.</t>
  <t>If both succeed, the registrar utilizes the PKCS#10 request contained in the JWS object body as "P10" parameter of "ietf-sztp-csr:csr" for further processing of the enrollment-request with the corresponding domain CA.
It creates a registrar enrollment-request (RER) by utilizing the protocol expected by the domain CA.
The domain registrar may either directly forward the provided PKCS#10 request to the CA or provide additional information about attributes to be included by the CA into the requested LDevID certificate.
The approach of sending this information to the CA depends on the utilized certificate management protocol between the RA and the CA and is out of scope for this document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note while BRSKI-PRM targets the initial enrollment, re-enrollment may be supported in a similar way with the exception that the current LDevID certificate is used instead of the IDevID certificate to verify the wrapping signature of the PKCS#10 request (see also <xref target="PER-response"/>).</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> send the PER to the registrar by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/requestenroll"</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.</t>

<t>A successful interaction with the domain CA will result in a pledge LDevID certificate, which is then forwarded by the registrar to the registrar-agent using the Content-Type header: <spanx style="verb">application/pkcs7-mime</spanx>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_2_wca"><name>Request Wrapped-CA-certificate(s) (Registrar-Agent to Registrar)</name>

<t>As the pledge will verify it own certificate LDevID certificate when received, it also needs the corresponding CA certificates.
This is done in EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> using the "/.well-known/est/cacerts" endpoint, which provides the CA certificates over a TLS protected connection.
BRSKI-PRM requires a signature wrapped CA certificate object, to avoid that the pledge can be provided with arbitrary CA certificates in an authorized way.
The registrar signed CA certificate object will allow the pledge to verify the authorization to install the received CA certificate(s).
As the CA certificate(s) are provided to the pledge after the voucher, the pledge has the required information (the domain certificate) to verify the wrapped CA certificate object.</t>

<t>To support registrar-agents requesting a signature wrapped CA certificate(s) object, a new endpoint for BRSKI-PRM is defined on the registrar: "/.well-known/brski/wrappedcacerts"</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> requests the EST CA trust anchor database information (in form of CA certificates) by HTTP GET.</t>

<t>The Content-Type header of the response <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be: <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx>.</t>

<t>This is a deviation from the Content-Type header values used in EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> and results in additional processing at the domain registrar (as EST server).
The additional processing is to sign the CA certificate(s) information using the registrar LDevID credentials.
This results in a signed CA certificate(s) object (JSON-in-JWS), the CA certificates are provided as base64 encoded "x5b" in the JWS payload.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> optionally use TLS to protect the communication as outlined in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent provides the information via distinct pledge endpoints as following.</t>

<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_3a"><name>Pledge: Voucher-Response Processing</name>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> send the voucher-response to the pledge by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/svr".</t>

<t>The registrar-agent voucher-response Content-Type header is <spanx style="verb">application/voucher-jws+json</spanx> and contains the voucher as provided by the MASA. An example is given in <xref target="MASA-vr"/> for a MASA  signed voucher and in <xref target="MASA-REG-vr"/> for the voucher with the additional signature of the registrar.</t>

<t>A nonceless voucher may be accepted as in <xref target="RFC8995"/> and may be allowed by a manufacture's pledge implementation.</t>

<t>To perform the validation of several signatures on the voucher object, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> perform the signature verification in the following order:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Verify MASA signature as described in Section 5.6.1 in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, against pre-installed manufacturer trust anchor (IDevID).</t>
  <t>Install trust anchor contained in the voucher ("pinned-domain-cert")  provisionally</t>
  <t>Validate the LDevID(Reg) certificate received in the agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert in the pledge-voucher-request trigger request (in the field "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert")</t>
  <t>Verify registrar signature of the voucher similar as described in Section 5.6.1 in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, but take the registrar certificate instead of the MASA certificate for the verification</t>
</list></t>

<t>Step3 and step 4 have been introduced in BRSKI-PRM to enable verification of LDevID(Reg) certificate and also the proof-of-possession of the corresponding private key by the registrar, which is done in BRSKI based on the established TLS channel.
If all steps stated above have been performed successfully, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> terminate the "PROVISIONAL accept" state for the domain trust anchor and the registrar LDevID certificate.</t>

<t>If an error occurs during the verification and validation of the voucher, this <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be reported in the reason field of the pledge voucher status.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_3b"><name>Pledge: Voucher Status Telemetry</name>

<t>After voucher verification and validation the pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a status telemetry message as defined in Section 5.7 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The pledge generates the voucher-status and provides it as signed JSON-in-JWS object in response to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t>The response has the Content-Type <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx> and is signed using the IDevID of the pledge as shown in <xref target="vstat"/>.
As the reason field is optional (see <xref target="RFC8995"/>), it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be omitted in case of success.</t>

<t>If the pledge did not did not provide voucher status telemetry information after processing the voucher, the registrar agent <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> query the pledge status explicitly as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_5"/> and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> re-sent the voucher depending on the Pledge status following the procedure described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_3a"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_3c"><name>Pledge: Wrapped-CA-Certificate(s) Processing</name>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> provide the set of CA certificates requested from the registrar to the pledge by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/scac".</t>

<t>As the CA certificate provisioning is crucial from a security perspective, this provisioning <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> only be done, if the voucher-response has been successfully processed by pledge as reflected in the voucher status telemetry.</t>

<t>The CA certificates message has the Content-Type <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx> and is signed using the credential of the registrar as shown in <xref target="PCAC"/>.</t>

<t>The CA certificates are provided as base64 encoded "x5b".
The pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> install the received CA certificates as trust anchor after successful verification of the registrar's signature.</t>

<t>The following 4xx client error codes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the pledge:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>403 Forbidden: if the validation of the wrapping signature or another security check fails.</t>
  <t>415 Unsupported Media Type: if the Content-Type of the request is in an unknown or unsupported format.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent enroll-response Content-Type header, when using EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> as enrollment protocol between the registrar-agent and the infrastructure is: <spanx style="verb">application/pkcs7-mime</spanx>.
Note: It only contains the LDevID certificate for the pledge, not the certificate chain.</t>

<t>Upon reception, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> verify the received LDevID certificate.
The pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> generate the enroll status and provide it in the response to the registrar-agent.
If the verification of the LDevID certificate succeeds, the status property <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be set to "status": true, otherwise to "status": false</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-enrollment-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge: Enrollment-Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reply with a status telemetry message as defined in Section 5.9.4 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
As for the other objects, the enroll-status is signed and results in a JSON-in-JWS object.
If the pledge verified the received LDevID certificate successfully it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> sign the response using its new LDevID credentials as shown in <xref target="estat"/>.
In the failure case, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> use the available IDevID credentials.

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide the collected pledge voucher status to the registrar.
This status indicates if the pledge could process the voucher successfully or not.</t>

<t>In case the TLS connection to the registrar is already closed, the registrar-agent opens a new TLS connection with the registrar as stated in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge voucher status without modification to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST using the registrar endpoint "/.well-known/brski/voucher_status". The Content-Type header is kept as <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx> as described in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_3"/> and depicted in the example in <xref target="vstat"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> verify the signature of the pledge voucher status and validate that it belongs to an accepted device of the domain based on the contained "serial-number" in the IDevID certificate referenced in the header of the voucher status.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> Section 5.7, the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.
The registrar-agent may use the response to signal success / failure to the service technician operating the registrar agent.
Within the server logs the server <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> capture this telemetry information.</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> proceed with collecting and logging status information by requesting the MASA audit-log from the MASA service as described in Section 5.8 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> provide the pledge's enroll status to the registrar.
The status indicates the pledge could process the enroll-response (certificate) and holds the corresponding private key.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge enroll status without modification to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST using the registrar endpoint "/.well-known/brski/enrollstatus".
The Content-Type header is kept as <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx> as described in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_3"/> and depicted in the example in <xref target="estat"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify the signature of the pledge enroll status.
Also, the registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> validate that the pledge is an accepted device of the domain based on the contained product-serial-number in the LDevID certificate referenced in the header of the enroll status.
The registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> log this event.
In case the pledge enroll status indicates a failure, the pledge was unable to verify the received LDevID certificate and therefore signed the enroll status with its IDevID credential.
Note that the signature verification of the status information is an addition to the described handling in Section 5.9.4 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>, and is replacing the pledges TLS client authentication by DevID credentials in <xref target="RFC8995"></xref>.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> Section 5.9.4, the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.
Based on the failure case the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> decide that for security reasons the pledge is not allowed to reside in the domain. In this case the registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> revoke the certificate.
An example case for the registrar revoking the issued LDevID for the pledge is when the pledge was not able to verify the received LDevID certificate and therefore did send a 406 (Not Acceptable) response. 
In this case the registrar may revoke the LDevID certificate as the pledge did no accepted it for installation.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent may use the response to signal success / failure to the service technician operating the registrar agent.
Within the server log the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> capture this telemetry information.</t>

<section anchor="exchanges_uc2_5a"><name>Pledge-Status - Request (Registrar-Agent to Pledge)</name>

<t>The registrar-agent requests the pledge-status via HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/qps"</t>

<t>The registrar-agent Content-Type header for the pledge-status request is: <spanx style="verb">application/jose+json</spanx>.
It contains information on the requested status-type, the time and date the request is created, and the product serial-number of the pledge contacted as shown in <xref target="stat_req_def"/>.
The pledge-status request is signed by registrar-agent using the LDevID(RegAgt) credential.</t>

<t>The following Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/> explains the structure of the format for the pledge-status request. It is defined following the status telemetry definitions in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Consequently, format and semantics of pledge-status requests below are for version 1.
The version field is included to permit significant changes to the pledge-status request and response in the future.
A pledge or a registrar-agent that receives a pledge-status request with a version larger than it knows about <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> log the contents and alert a human.</t>

<figure title="CDDL for pledge-status request" anchor="stat_req_def"><artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

  }
<CODE ENDS>
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The status-type defined for BRSKI-PRM is "bootstrap".
This indicates the pledge to provide current status information regarding the bootstrapping status (voucher processing and enrollment of the pledge into the new domain).
As the pledge-status request is defined generic, it may be used by other specifications to request further status information, e.g., for onboarding to get further information about enrollment of application specific LDevIDs or other parameters.
This is out of scope for this specification.</t>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>

<t>In general, the privacy considerations of <xref target="RFC8995"/> apply for BRSKI-PRM also.
Further privacy aspects need to be considered for:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the introduction of the additional component registrar-agent</t>
  <t>potentially no transport layer security between registrar-agent and pledge</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/> describes to optional apply TLS to protect the communication between the registrar-agent and the pledge.
The following is therefore applicable to the communication without the TLS protection.</t>

<t>The credential used by the registrar-agent to sign the data for the pledge <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> contain any personal information.
Therefore, it is recommended to use an LDevID certificate associated with the commissioning device instead of an LDevID certificate associated with the service technician operating the device.
This avoids revealing potentially included personal information to Registrar and MASA.</t>

<t>The communication between the pledge and the registrar-agent is performed over plain HTTP.
Therefore, it is subject to disclosure by a Dolev-Yao attacker (an "oppressive observer")<xref target="onpath"/>.
Depending on the requests and responses, the following information is disclosed.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the Pledge product-serial-number is contained in the trigger message for the PVR and in all responses from the pledge.
This information reveals the identity of the devices being bootstrapped and allows deduction of which products an operator is using in their environment.
As the communication between the pledge and the registrar-agent may be realized over wireless link, this information could easily be eavesdropped, if the wireless network is unencrypted.
Even if the wireless network is encrypted, if it uses a network-wide key, then layer-2 attacks (ARP/ND spoofing) could insert an on-path observer into the path.</t>
  <t>the Timestamp data could reveal the activation time of the device.</t>
  <t>the Status data of the device could reveal information about the current state of the device in the domain network.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec_cons"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>In general, the security considerations of <xref target="RFC8995"/> apply for BRSKI-PRM also.
Further security aspects are considered here related to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the introduction of the additional component registrar-agent</t>
  <t>the reversal of the pledge communication direction (push mode, compared to BRSKI)</t>
  <t>no transport layer security between registrar-agent and pledge</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="denial-of-service-dos-attack-on-pledge"><name>Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Pledge</name>

<t>Disrupting the pledge behavior by a DoS attack may prevent the bootstrapping of the pledge to a new domain.</t>

<t>A DoS attack with a faked registrar-agent may block the bootstrapping of the pledge due changing state on the pledge (the pledge may produce a voucher-request, and refuse to produce another one).
One mitigation may be that the pledge does not limited the number of voucher-requests it creates until at least one has finished.
An alternative may be that the onboarding state may expire after a certain time, if no further interaction has happened.</t>

<t>In addition, the pledge may assume that repeated triggering for PVR are the result of a communication error with the registrar-agent.
In that case the pledge <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> simply resent the PVR previously sent. 
Note that in case of resending, a contained nonce and also the contained agent-signed-data in the PVR would consequently be reused.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="misuse-of-acquired-pvr-and-per-by-registrar-agent"><name>Misuse of acquired PVR and PER by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>A registrar-agent that uses previously requested PVR and PER for domain-A, may attempt to onboard the device into domain-B.  This can be detected by the domain registrar while PVR processing.
The domain registrar needs to verify that the "proximity-registrar-cert" field in the PVR matches its own registrar LDevID certificate.
In addition, the domain registrar needs to verify the association of the pledge to its domain based on the product-serial-number contained in the PVR and in the IDevID certificate of the pledge. (This is just part of the supply chain integration).
Moreover, the domain registrar verifies if the registrar-agent is authorized to interact with the pledge for voucher-requests and enroll-requests, based on the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data contained in the PVR.</t>

<t>Misbinding of a pledge by a faked domain registrar is countered as described in BRSKI security considerations <xref target="RFC8995"/> (Section 11.4).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec_cons_reg-agt"><name>Misuse of Registrar-Agent Credentials</name>

<t>Concerns of misusage of a registrar-agent with a valid LDevID(RegAgt), may be addressed by utilizing short-lived certificates (e.g., valid for a day) to authenticate the registrar-agent against the domain registrar.
The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate may be acquired by a prior BRSKI run for the registrar-agent, if an IDevID is available on registrar-agent.
Alternatively, the LDevID may be acquired by a service technician from the domain PKI system in an authenticated way.</t>

<t>In addition it is required that the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate is valid for the complete bootstrapping phase.
This avoids that a registrar-agent could be misused to create arbitrary "agent-signed-data" objects to perform an authorized bootstrapping of a rogue pledge at a later point in time.
In this misuse "agent-signed-data" could be dated after the validity time of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate, due to missing trusted timestamp in the registrar-agents signature.
To address this, the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> verify the certificate used to create the signature on "agent-signed-data".
Furthermore the registrar also verifies the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate used in the TLS handshake with the registrar-agent. If both certificates are verified successfully, the registrar-agent's signature can be considered as valid.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec_cons_mDNS"><name>Misuse of mDNS to obtain list of pledges</name>

<t>To discover a specific pledge a registrar-agent may request the service name in combination with the product-serial-number of a specific pledge.
The pledge reacts on this if its product-serial-number is part of the request message.</t>

<t>If the registrar-agent performs DNS-based Service Discovery without a specific product-serial-number, all  pledges in the domain react if the functionality is supported.
This functionality enumerates and reveals the information of devices available in the domain.
The information about this is provided here as a feature to support the commissioning of devices.
A manufacturer may decide to support this feature only for devices not possessing a LDevID or to not support this feature at all, to avoid an enumeration in an operative domain.</t>

<t>The YANG module specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-rfc8366bis"/> defines the schema for data that is subsequently encapsulated by a JOSE signed-data Content-type as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.
As such, all of the YANG-modeled data is protected against modification.</t>

<t>The use of YANG to define data structures via the <xref target="RFC8971"/> "structure" statement, is relatively
new and distinct from the traditional use of YANG to define an API accessed by network management protocols such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
For this reason, these guidelines do not follow the template described by <xref target="RFC8407"/> Section 3.7 (Security Considerations Section).</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important. In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t>
      <t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t>
      <t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t>

This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline. We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device. The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.</t>
      <t>CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</t>

One strategy, called the "single backslash" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line. The second strategy, called the "double backslash" strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy. Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document defines an enhancement of Bootstrapping Remote Secure
   Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC 8995) that supports alternative
   certificate enrollment protocols, such as CMP.  This offers the
   following advantages.

   Using authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification
   requests and responses, their origin can be authenticated
   independently of message transfer.  This supports end-to-end
   authentication (proof of origin) also over multiple hops, as well as
   asynchronous operation of certificate enrollment.  This in turn
   provides architectural flexibility where to ultimately authenticate
   and authorize certification requests while retaining full-strength
   integrity and authenticity of certification requests.

	 <t>   This document describes a method by which an unconfigured device can
   use EAP to join a network on which further device onboarding, network
   attestation or other remediation can be done.  While RFC 5216
   supports EAP-TLS without a client certificate, that document defines
   no method by which unauthenticated EAP-TLS can be used.  This draft
   addresses that issue.  First, by defining the @eap.arpa domain, and
   second by showing how it can be used to provide quarantined network
   access for onboarding unauthenticated devices.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document provides a taxonomy of methods used by manufacturers of
   silicon and devices to secure private keys and public trust anchors.
   This deals with two related activities: how trust anchors and private
   keys are installed into devices during manufacturing, and how the
   related manufacturer held private keys are secured against
   disclosure.

   This document does not evaluate the different mechanisms, but rather
   just serves to name them in a consistent manner in order to aid in
   communication.

<section anchor="pledgehttps"><name>HTTPS operations between Registrar-Agent and Pledge</name>

<t>The use of HTTPS between the Registrar-Agent and the Pledge has been identified as an optional mechanism.</t>

<t>Provided that the key-agreement in the underlying TLS protocol connection can be properly authenticated, the use of TLS provides privacy for the voucher and enrollment operations between the pledge and the registrar-agent.
The authenticity of the onboarding and enrollment is not dependant upon the security of the TLS connection.</t>

<t>The use of HTTPS is not mandated by this document for a number of reasons:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A certificate is generally required in order to do TLS.  While there are other modes of authentication including PSK, various EAP methods and raw public key, they do no help as there is no previous relationship between the Registrar-Agent.</t>
  <t>The pledge can use it's IDevID certificate to authenticate itself, but <xref target="RFC6125"/> DNS-ID methods do not apply as the pledge does not have a FQDN.  Instead a new mechanism is required, which authenticates the X520SerialNumber DN attribute which must be present in every IDevID.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If the Registrar-Agent has a preconfigured list of which serial numbers, from which manufacturers it expects to see, then it can attempt to match this pledge against a list of potential devices.</t>

<t>In many cases only the list of manufacturers is known ahead of time, so at most the Registrar-Agent can show the X520SerialNumber to the (human) operator who may then attempt to confirm that they are standing in front of a device with that serial number.
The use of scannable QRcodes may help automate this in some cases.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>The CA used to sign the IDevID will be a manufacturer private PKI as described in <xref section="4.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="I-D.irtf-t2trg-taxonomy-manufacturer-anchors"/>.
The anchors for this PKI will never be part of the public WebPKI anchors which are distributed with most smartphone operating systems.
A registrar-agent application will need to use different APIs in order to initiate an HTTPS connection without performing WebPKI verification.
The application will then have to do it's own certificate chain verification against a store of manufacturer trust anchors.
In the Android ecosystem this involved use of a customer TrustManager: many application developers do not create these correctly, and there is significant push to remove this option as it has repeatedly resulted in security failures. See <xref target="androidtrustfail"/></t>
  <t>The use of the Host: (or :authority in HTTP/2) is explained in <xref section="7.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9110"/>. This header is mandatory, and so a compliant HTTPS client is going to insert it.
But, the contents of this header will at best be an IP address that came from the discovery process.
The pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> therefore ignore the Host: header when it processes requests, and the pledge <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> do any kind of name-base virtual hosting using the IP address/port combination.
Note that there is no requirement for the pledge to operate it's BRSKI-PRM service on port 80 or port 443, so if there is no reason for name-based virtual hosting.</t>
  <t>Note that an Extended Key Usage (EKU) for TLS WWW Server authentication cannot be expected in the pledge's IDevID certificate.
IDevID certificates are intended to be widely useable and EKU does not support that use.</t>

<t>From IETF draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 -&gt; IETF anima-brski-prm-00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode from
draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 to this document
This required changes and adaptations in several sections to remove
the description and references to UC1.</t>
  <t>Addressed feedback for voucher-request enhancements from YANG doctor
early review in <xref target="voucher-request-prm-yang"/> as well as in the
security considerations (formerly named ietf-async-voucher-request).</t>
  <t>Renamed ietf-async-voucher-request to IETF-voucher-request-prm to
to allow better listing of voucher related extensions; aligned with
constraint voucher (#20)</t>
  <t>Utilized ietf-voucher-request-async instead of ietf-voucher-request
in voucher exchanges to utilize the enhanced voucher-request.</t>
  <t>Included changes from draft-ietf-netconf-sztp-csr-06 regarding the
YANG definition of csr-types into the enrollment request exchange.</t>

<t>From IETF draft 01 -&gt; IETF draft 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
remaining objects with this approach in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/>.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -&gt; registrar-agent to
better underline agent relation.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -&gt; pledge-initiator-mode
and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.</t>
  <t>Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
the security considerations.</t>
  <t>Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID

which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 in <xref target="architecture"/> to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.</t>
  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints do not
result in additional /.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.</t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
new section as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>
  <t>Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
pledge-agent use case <xref target="architecture"/>, e.g. to
accommodate distribution of CA certificates.</t>
  <t>Updated CMP example in to use lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
the necessary /.well-known endpoints.</t>
  <t>Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
<xref target="req-sol"/>. Shortened description of proof
of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.</t>
  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in UC1 to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an offsite PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-PRM call flow.</t>

  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="sup-env"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and

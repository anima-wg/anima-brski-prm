    <abstract>


<t>This document defines enhancements to bootstrapping a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI, <xref target="RFC8995"/> ) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar.
It specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model changes from a pledge-initiator-mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge-responder-mode as described in this document.
To support both, BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar-agent component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase.
To enable the establishment of a trust relation between a pledge and the domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (signature-wrapped objects).
The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the domain registrar to communicate with the Domain CA.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>BRSKI as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> specifies a solution for secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrapping of devices (pledges) in a (customer) site domain.
This includes the discovery of network elements in the target domain, time synchronization, and the exchange of security information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the domain.
Security information about the target domain, specifically the target domain certificate, is exchanged utilizing voucher objects as defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
These vouchers are signed objects, provided via the domain registrar to the pledge and originate from a Manufacturer's Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).</t>

<t>BRSKI addresses scenarios in which the pledge acts as client for the bootstrapping and is the initiator of the bootstrapping (this document refers to the approach as pledge-initiator-mode).
In industrial environments the pledge may behave as a server and thus does not initiate the bootstrapping with the domain registrar.
In this scenarios it is expected that the pledge will be triggered to generate request objects to be bootstrapped in the registrar's domain (this document refers to the approach as pledge-responder-mode).
For this, an additional component is introduced acting as an agent for the domain registrar (registrar-agent) towards the pledge.
This may be a functionality of a commissioning tool or it may be even co-located with the registrar.
In contrast to BRSKI the registrar-agent performs the object exchange with the pledge and provides/retrieves data objects to/from the domain registrar.
For the interaction with the domain registrar the registrar-agent will use existing BRSKI endpoints.</t>

<t>The goal is to enhance BRSKI to support pledges in responder mode also.
This is addressed by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>introducing the registrar-agent as new component to facilitate the communication between the pledge and the registrar, when the pledge is in responder mode (acting as server).</t>
  <t>handling the security on application layer only to enable application of arbitrary transport means between the pledge and the domain registrar, by keeping the registrar-agent in the communication path.
Examples may be connectivity via IP based networks (wired or wireless) but also connectivity via Bluetooth or NFC between the pledge and the registrar-agent.</t>
  <t>allowing to utilize credentials different from the pledge's IDevID to establish a TLS connection to the domain registrar, which is necessary in case of using a registrar-agent.</t>
  <t>defining the interaction (data exchange and data objects) between a pledge acting as server and a registrar-agent and the domain registrar.</t>
</list></t>

<t>For the enrollment of devices BRSKI relies on EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> to request and distribute target domain specific device certificates.
EST in turn relies on a binding of the certification request to an underlying TLS connection between the EST client and the EST server.
According to BRSKI the domain registrar acts as EST server and is also acting as registration authority (RA) for its domain.
To utilize the EST server endpoints on the domain-registrar, the registrar-agent defined in this document will act as client towards the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent will also act as client when communicating with the pledge in responder mode. 
Here, TLS with server-side, certificate-based authentication is not directly applicable, as the pledge only possesses an IDevID certificate, which does not contain a subject alternative name (SAN) for the target domain and does also not contain a TLS server flag. 
This is one reason for relying on higher layer security by using signature wrapped objects for the exchange between the pledge and the registrar agent. 
A further reason is the application on different transports, for which TLS may not be available, like Bluetooth or NFC.
As the described solution will rely on additional wrapping signature it will require pre-processing specifically for EST, as it currently uses PKCS#10 requests only.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope-of-solution"><name>Scope of Solution</name>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Environment</name>

<t>The described solution is applicable in domains in which pledges have no direct connection to the domain registrar, but are expected to be managed by this registrar.
This can be motivated by pledges featuring a different technology stack or by pledges without an existing connection to the domain registrar during bootstrapping.
These pledges are likely to act in a server role.
Therefore, the pledge has to offer endpoints on which it can be triggered for the generation of pledge-voucher-request objects and certification objects as well as to provide the response objects to the pledge.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>The following examples are intended to motivate the support of additional bootstrapping approaches in general by introducing industrial applications cases, which could leverage BRSKI as such but also require support a pledge acting as server and only answers requests as well as scenarios with limited connectivity to the registrar.</t>

<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation, a use case can be described by a detached building (or a cabinet) or the basement of a building equipped with sensor, actuators, and controllers connected, but with only limited or no connection to the centralized building management system.
This limited connectivity may be during the installation time but also during operation time.
During the installation in the basement, a service technician collects the device specific information from the basement network and provides them to the central building management system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile device to transport the information.
A domain registrar may be part of the central building management system and already be operational in the installation network.
The central building management system can then provide operational parameters for the specific devices in the basement.
This operational parameters may comprise values and settings required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, beyond them a certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other components and services.
These operational parameters are then provided to the devices in the basement facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for security reasons.
In such a case, limited access to a domain registrar may be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of time, for example when a batch of new devices are deployed, but impossible at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="less-operational-security-in-the-target-domain"><name>Less Operational Security in the Target-Domain</name>

<t>The registration authority (RA) performing the authorization of a certificate request is a critical PKI component and therefore implicates higher operational security than other components utilizing the issued certificates .
CAs may also demand higher security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be the situation in which the target domain does not offer enough security to operate a RA/CA and therefore this service is transferred to a backend that offers a higher level of operational security.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="limitations"><name>Limitations</name>

<t>The mechanisms in this draft presume the availability of the pledge to communicate with the registrar-agent.<br />
This may not be possible in constrained environments where, in particular, power must be conserved.<br />
In these situations, it is anticipated that the transceiver will be powered down most of the time.<br />
This presents a rendezvous problem: the pledge is unavailable for certain periods of time, and the registrar-agent is similarly presumed to be unavailable for certain periods of time.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirements Discussion and Mapping to Solution-Elements</name>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and the motivated application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/> the following base requirements are derived to support to support the communication between a pledge and a registrar over a registrar-agent.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of Possession (POP): proves that an entity possesses and controls the private key corresponding to the public key contained in the certification request, typically by adding a signature using the private key.</t>
  <t>Proof of Identity (POI): provides data-origin authentication of a data object, e.g., a certificate request, utilizing an existing IDevID.
Certificate updates may utilize the certificate that is to be updated.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Solution examples based on existing technology are provided with the focus on existing IETF documents:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Voucher request and response objects as used in <xref target="RFC8995"/> already provide both, POP and POI, through a digital signature to protect the integrity of the voucher object, while the corresponding signing certificate contains the identity of the signer.</t>
  <t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are data structures containing the information from a requester for a CA to create a certificate. 
The certification request format in BRSKI utilizes PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>.
Here, the structure is signed to ensure integrity protection and proof of possession of the private key of the requester that corresponds to the contained public key.
In the considered application examples, this is not sufficient to provide data origin authentication and therefore needs to be bound to the existing credential of the pledge (IDevID) additionally.
This binding supports the authorization decision for the certification request through a proof of identity.
The binding of data origin authentication to the certification request may be delegated to the protocol used for certificate management or it may be provided directly by the certification request object.
While BRSKI uses the binding to TLS, BRSKI-PRM aims at an additional signature of the PCKS#10 object using the existing credential on the pledge (IDevID).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architectural Overview and Communication Exchanges</name>

<t>For BRSKI with pledge in responder mode, the base system architecture defined in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is enhanced to facilitate the new use case.
The pledge-responder-mode allows delegated bootstrapping using a registrar-agent instead of a direct connection from the pledge to the domain registrar.
The communication model between registrar-agent and pledge in this document assumes that the pledge is acting as server and responds to requests.</t>

<t>Necessary enhancements to support authenticated self-contained objects for certificate enrollment are kept at a minimum to ensure reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.</t>

<t>For the authenticated self-contained objects used for the certification request, BRSKI-PRM relies on the defined message wrapping mechanisms of the enrollment protocols stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> above.</t>

<section anchor="uc2"><name>Pledge-responder-mode (PRM): Registrar-agent Communication with Pledges</name>

<t>To support mutual trust establishment of pledges, not directly connected to the domain registrar, this document relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (the voucher request/response objects as known from BRSKI and the enrollment request/response objects as introduced by BRSKI-PRM).
This allows independence from protection provided by the utilized transport protocol.</t>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI, the object exchanges with the domain registrar are performed with the help of a registrar-agent component.
The registrar-agent may be an integrated functionality of a commissioning tool.
This leads to enhancements of the logical elements in the BRSKI architecture as shown in <xref target="uc2figure"/>.
The registrar-agent interacts with the pledge to acquire and to supply the required data objects for bootstrapping, which are also exchanged between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
Moreover, the addition of the registrar-agent influences the sequences of the data exchange between the pledge and the domain registrar described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
A general goal for the registrar-agent application is the reuse of already defined endpoints of the domain registrar side.
The functionality of the already existing registrar endpoints may need small enhancements to cope with the additional signatures.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc2figure"/> utilizes the same logical components as BRSKI with the registrar-agent component in addition.</t>

<t>For authentication towards the domain registrar, the registrar-agent uses its LDevID.
The provisioning of the registrar-agent LDevID may be done by a separate BRSKI run or other means in advance.
It is recommended to use short lived registrar-agent LDevIDs in the range of days or weeks.</t>

<t>If a registrar detects a request originates from a registrar-agent it is able to switch the operational mode from BRSKI to BRSKI-PRM.</t>

<t>In addition, the domain registrar may authenticate the user operating the registrar-agent to perform additional authorization of a pledge bootstrapping action.
Examples for such user level authentication may be HTTP authentication or the usage of authorization tokens or other.
This is out of scope of this document.</t>

<t>The following list describes the components in a (customer) site domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pledge: The pledge is expected to respond with the necessary data objects for bootstrapping to the registrar-agent.
The transport protocol used between the pledge and the registrar-agent is assumed to be HTTP in the context of this document.
Other transport protocols may be used like Bluetooth or NFC, but are out of scope of this document.
A pledge acting as a server during bootstrapping leads to some differences to BRSKI:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Discovery of the domain registrar by the pledge is not needed as the pledge will be triggered by the registrar-agent.</t>
      <t>Discovery of the pledge by the registrar-agent must be possible.</t>
      <t>As the registrar-agent must be able to request data objects for bootstrapping of the pledge, the pledge must offer corresponding endpoints.</t>
      <t>The registrar-agent may provide additional data to the pledge, in the context of the triggering request, to make itself visible to the domain registrar.</t>
      <t>Order of exchanges in the call flow may be different as the registrar-agent collects both objects, pledge-voucher-request objects and pledge-enrollment-request objects, at once and provides them to the registrar.
This approach may also be used to perform a bulk bootstrapping of several devices.</t>
      <t>The data objects utilized for the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar are self-contained authenticated objects (signature-wrapped objects).</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Registrar-agent: provides a communication path to exchange data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent facilitates situations, in which the domain registrar is not directly reachable by the pledge, either due to a different technology stack or due to missing connectivity.
The registrar-agent triggers a pledge to create bootstrapping information such as voucher-request objects and enrollment-request objects from one or multiple pledges at once and performs a bulk bootstrapping based on the collected data.
The registrar-agent is expected to possess information of the domain registrar, either by configuration or by using the discovery mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
There is no trust assumption between the pledge and the registrar-agent as only authenticated self-contained objects are applied, which are transported via the registrar-agent and provided either by the pledge or the registrar.
The trust assumption between the registrar-agent and the registrar bases on the LDevID of the registrar-agent, provided by the PKI responsible for the domain. 
This allows the registrar-agent to authenticate towards the registrar, e.g., in a TLS handshake.
Based on this, the registrar is able to distinguish a pledge from a registrar-agent during the session establishment.</t>
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Note that it may be used by the registrar-agent instead of the pledge to find the registrar, if not configured.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar: In general the domain registrar fulfills the same functionality regarding the bootstrapping of the pledge in a (customer) site domain by facilitating the communication of the pledge with the MASA service and the domain PKI service.
In contrast to <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the domain registrar does not interact with a pledge directly but  through the registrar-agent.
The registrar detects if the bootstrapping is performed by the pledge directly or by the  registrar-agent.
The manufacturer provided components/services (MASA and Ownership tracker) are used as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
For issuing a voucher, the MASA may perform additional checks on voucher-request objects, to issue a voucher indicating agent-proximity instead of (registrar-)proximity.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="agent-proximity"><name>Agent-Proximity</name>

<t>"Agent-proximity" is a weaker assertion then "proximity".
It is defined as additional assertion type in <xref target="I-D.richardson-anima-rfc8366bis"/>
In case of "agent-proximity" it is a statement, that the proximity-registrar-certificate was provided via the registrar-agent and not directly to the pledge.
This can be verified by the registrar and also by the MASA during the voucher-request processing.
Note that at the time of creating the voucher-request, the pledge cannot verify the registrar's LDevID(Reg) EE certificate and has no proof-of-possession of the corresponding private key for the certificate.
Trust handover to the domain is established via the "pinned-domain-certificate" in the voucher.</t>

<t>In contrast, "proximity" provides a statement, that the pledge was in direct contact with the registrar and was able to verify proof-of-possession of the private key in the context of the TLS handshake.
The provisionally accepted LDevID(Reg) EE certificate can be verified after the voucher has been processed by the pledge.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge_ep"><name>Behavior of Pledge in Pledge-Responder-Mode</name>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI the pledge acts as a server component.
It is triggered by the registrar-agent for the generation of pledge-voucher-request and pledge-enrollment-request objects as well as for the processing of the response objects and the generation of status information.
Due to the use of the registrar-agent, the interaction with the domain registrar is changed as shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_1"/>.
To enable interaction with the registrar-agent, the pledge provides endpoints using the BRSKI interface based on the "/.well-known/brski" URI tree.</t>

<t>The following endpoints are defined for the <em>pledge</em> in this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher-request: trigger pledge to create voucher request.
It returns the pledge-voucher-request.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment-request: trigger pledge to create enrollment request.
It returns the pledge-enrollment-request.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher: supply MASA provided voucher to pledge.
It returns the pledge-voucher-status.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment: supply enroll response (certificate) to pledge.
It returns the pledge-enrollment-status.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-CACerts: supply CACerts to pledge (optional).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="behavior-of-registrar-agent"><name>Behavior of Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The registrar-agent is a new component in the BRSKI context.
It provides connectivity between the pledge and the domain registrar and reuses the endpoints of the domain registrar side already specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
It facilitates the exchange of data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar, which are the voucher request/response objects, the enrollment request/response objects, as well as related status objects.
For the communication the registrar-agent utilizes communication endpoints provided by the pledge.
The transport in this specification is based on HTTP but may also be done using other transport mechanisms.
This new component changes the general interaction between the pledge and the domain registrar as shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent is expected to already possess an LDevID(RegAgt) to authenticate towards the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent will use this LDevID(RegAgt) when establishing the TLS session with the domain registrar in the context of for TLS client-side authentication.
The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include a SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID), which is used as reference in the context of an agent-signed-data object as defined in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/>.
Note that this is an additional requirement for issuing the certificate, as <xref target="IEEE-802.1AR"/> only requires the SKID to be included for intermediate CA certificates.
In BRSKI-PRM, the SKID is used in favor of a certificate fingerprint to avoid additional computations.</t>

<t>Using an LDevID for TLS client-side authentication is a deviation from <xref target="RFC8995"/>, in which the pledge's IDevID credential is used to perform TLS client authentication.
The use of the LDevID(RegAgt) allows the domain registrar to distinguish, if bootstrapping is initiated from a pledge or from a registrar-agent and adopt the internal handling accordingly.
As BRSKI-PRM uses authenticated self-contained data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar, the binding of the pledge identity to the request object is provided by the data object signature employing the pledge's IDevID.
The objects exchanged between the pledge and the domain registrar used in the context of this specifications are JOSE objects</t>

<t>In addition to the LDevID(RegAgt), the registrar-agent is provided with the product-serial-numbers of the pledges to be bootstrapped.
This is necessary to allow the discovery of pledges by the registrar-agent using mDNS.
The list may be provided by administrative means or the registrar agent may get the information via an interaction with the pledge, like scanning of product-serial-number information using a QR code or similar.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 5.3, the domain registrar performs the pledge authorization for bootstrapping within his domain based on the pledge voucher-request object.</t>

<t>The following information must therefore be available at the registrar-agent:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>LDevID(RegAgt): own operational key pair.</t>
  <t>LDevID(reg) certificate: certificate of the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>Serial-number(s): product-serial-number(s) of pledge(s) to be bootstrapped.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="discovery_uc2_reg"><name>Discovery of Registrar by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The discovery of the domain registrar may be done as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/> with the
deviation that it is done between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
Alternatively, the registrar-agent may be configured with the address of the domain registrar and the certificate of the domain registrar.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery_uc2_ppa"><name>Discovery of Pledge by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>The discovery of the pledge by registrar-agent should be done by using DNS-based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/> over Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> to discover the pledge at “product-serial-number.brski-pledge._tcp.local.”
The pledge constructs a local host name based on device local information (product-serial-number), which results in "product-serial-number.brski-pledge._tcp.local."
It can then be discovered by the registrar-agent via mDNS. Note that other mechanisms for discovery may be used.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent is able to build the same information based on the provided list of product-serial-number.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2"><name>Bootstrapping Objects and Corresponding Exchanges</name>

<t>The interaction of the pledge with the registrar-agent may be accomplished using different transport means (protocols and or network technologies).
For this document the usage of HTTP is targeted as in BRSKI.
Alternatives may be CoAP, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Nearfield Communication (NFC).
This requires independence of the exchanged data objects between the pledge and the registrar from transport security.
Therefore, authenticated self-contained objects (here: signature-wrapped objects) are applied in the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent provides the domain-registrar certificate (LDevID(Reg) EE certificate) to the pledge to be included into the "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate" leaf of the pledge-voucher-request object.
This enables the registrar to verify, that it is the target registrar for handling the request.
The registrar certificate may be configured at the registrar-agent or may be fetched by the registrar-agent based on a prior TLS connection establishment with the domain registrar.
In addition, the registrar-agent provides agent-signed-data containing the product-serial-number in the body, signed with the LDevID(RegAgt).
This enables the registrar to verify and log, which registrar-agent was in contact with the pledge, when verifying the pledge-voucher-request.
Optionally the registrar-agent may provide its LDevID(RegAgt) EE certificate to the pledge to be used in the "agent-sign-cert" properties of the pledge-voucher-request.
Note, this may be omitted in constraint environments to safe bandwidth between the registrar-agent and the pledge.
If not contained, the registrar-agent <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fetch the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate based on the SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) in the header of the agent-signed-data.
The registrar may include the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate information into the registrar-voucher-request.</t>

<t>The MASA in turn verifies the LDevID(Reg) certificate is included in the pledge-voucher-request (prior-signed-voucher-request) in the "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate" leaf and may assert in the voucher "verified" or "logged" instead of "proximity", as there is no direct connection between the pledge and the registrar.
If the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate information is contained in the "agent-sign-cert" properties of the registrar-voucher-request, the MASA can verify the signature of the agent-signed-data contained in the prior-signed-voucher-request.
If both can be verified successfully, the MASA can assert "agent-proximity" in the voucher. Otherwise, it may assert "verified" or "logged".
The voucher can then be supplied via the registrar to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t>Triggering the pledge to create the pledge-voucher-request is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint "/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher-request".</t>

<t>The pledge-voucher-request Content-Type is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> as:</t>

<t>application/voucher-jws+json</t>

<t>The pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include this Content-Type header field indicating the included media type for the voucher response.
Note that this is also an indication regarding the acceptable format of the voucher response.
This format is included by the registrar as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>Once the registrar-agent has received the pledge-voucher-request it can trigger the pledge to generate an enrollment-request object.
As in BRSKI the enrollment request object is a PKCS#10, but additionally signed using the pledge's IDevID.
Note, as the initial enrollment aims to request a general certificate, no certificate attributes are provided to the pledge.</t>

<t>Triggering the pledge to create the enrollment-request is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint "/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment-request".</t>

<t>The registrar-agent pledge-enrollment-request Content-Type header is: <spanx style="verb">application/json</spanx>
with an empty body.</t>

<t>Note that using HTTP POST allows for an empty body, but also to provide additional data, like CSR attributes or information about the enroll type: initial or re-enroll.
In the following the enrollment is described as initial enrollment.</t>

<t>Upon receiving the enrollment-trigger, the pledge <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> construct the pledge-enrollment-request as authenticated self-contained object.
The CSR already assures proof of possession of the private key corresponding to the contained public key.
In addition, based on the additional signature using the IDevID, proof of identity is provided.
Here, a JOSE object is being created in which the body utilizes the YANG module ietf-ztp-types with the grouping for csr-grouping for the CSR as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/>.</t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /*
Open Issues: Verification of usage of ietf-ztp-types to convey the 
P10 in enrollment request. 
*/</t>

<t>Depending on the capability of the pledge, it constructs the enrollment request as plain PKCS#10.
Note that the focus in this use case is placed on PKCS#10 as PKCS#10 can be transmitted in different enrollment protocols like EST, CMP, CMS, and SCEP.
If the pledge is already implementing an enrollment protocol, it may leverage that functionality for the creation of the enrollment request object.
Note also that <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> also allows for inclusion of certification request objects such as CMP or CMC.</t>

<t>The pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> construct the pledge-enrollment-request as PKCS#10 object.
In this case it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> sign it additionally with its IDevID credential to achieve proof-of-identity bound to the PKCS#10 as described below.</t>

<t>A successful enrollment will result in a generic LDevID certificate for the pledge in the new domain, which can be used to request further LDevID certificates if necessary for its operation.</t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /* Open Issues: Depending on target
environment, it may be useful to assume that the pledge may already
"know" its functional scope and therefore the number of certificates
needed during operation.  As a result, multiple CSRs may be generated
to provide achieve multiple certificates as a result of the
enrollment.  This would need further description and potential
enhancements also in the enrollment-request object to transport
different CSRs. */</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> considers PKCS#10 but also CMP and CMC as certification request format. Note that the wrapping signature is only necessary for plain PKCS#10 as other request formats like CMP and CMS support the signature wrapping as part of their own certificate request format.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent enrollment-request Content-Type header for a wrapped PKCS#10 is: <spanx style="verb">application/jose</spanx></t>

<t>The header of the pledge enrollment-request <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain the following parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"/>:</t>

<t>Once the registrar-agent has collected the pledge-voucher-request and pledge-enrollment-request objects, it connects to the registrar and sends the request objects.
As the registrar-agent is intended to work between the pledge and the domain registrar, a  collection of requests from more than one pledges is possible, allowing a bulk bootstrapping of multiple pledges using the same connection between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent establishes a TLS connection with the registrar.
As already stated in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the use of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged.
TLS 1.2 or newer is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> on the registrar-agent side.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be available on the registrar, but TLS 1.2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be available on the MASA, but TLS 1.2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.</t>

<t>In contrast to <xref target="RFC8995"/> client authentication is achieved by using the LDevID(RegAgt) of the registrar-agent instead of the IDevID of the pledge.
This allows the registrar to distinguish between pledge-initiator-mode and pledge-responder-mode. In pledge-responder-mode the registrar has no direct connection to the pledge but via the registrar-agent.
The registrar can receive request objects in different forms as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>. Specifically, the registrar will receive JOSE objects from the pledge for voucher-request and enrollment-request (instead of the objects for voucher-request (CMS-signed JSON) and enrollment-request (PKCS#10).</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge-voucher-request to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST to the endpoint "/.well-known/brski/requestvoucher".</t>

<t>The pledge-voucher-request Content-Type used in the pledge-responder-mode is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> as: <spanx style="verb">application/voucher-jws+json</spanx></t>

<t>(see <xref target="pvr"/> for the content definition).</t>

<t>The registrar-agent <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> include the "Accept" header field indicating the pledge acceptable Content-Type for the voucher-response.
The voucher-response Content-Type "application/voucher-jws+json" is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>Upon reception of the pledge-voucher-request, the registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> perform the verification of the voucher-request parameter as defined in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In addition, the registrar shall verify the following parameters from the pledge-voucher-request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the own LDevID(Reg) EE certificate to ensure the registrar in proximity is the target registrar for the request.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the data has been signed with the LDevID(RegAgt) credential indicated in the "kid" JOSE header parameter.
If the certificate is not contained in the agent-sign-cert properties of the pledge-voucher-request, it must fetch from a repository.</t>
  <t>agent-sign-cert: May contain the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data.
If contained the registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the credentials used to sign the data have been valid at signature creation time and that the corresponding registrar-agent was authorized to be involved in the bootstrapping process.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If validation fails the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with the HTTP 404 error code to the registrar-agent.
If the pledge-voucher-request is in an unknown format, then an HTTP 406 error code is more appropriate.</t>

<t>If validation succeeds, the registrar will accept the pledge request to join the domain as defined in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The registrar then establishes a TLS connection with the MASA as described in section 5.4 of <xref target="RFC8995"/> to obtain a voucher for the pledge.</t>

<t>The registrar <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> construct the body of the registrar-voucher-request object as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The encoding <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be done as JOSE object as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>The header of the registrar-voucher-request <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> contain the following parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.</t>
  <t>x5c: contains the base64-encoded registrar LDevID certificate.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The payload of the registrar-voucher-request (RVR) object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the following parameter as part of the voucher as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>created-on: contains the current date and time in yang:date-and-time format for the registrar-voucher-request creation time.</t>
  <t>nonce: copied form the pledge-voucher-request</t>
  <t>serial-number: contains the pledge product-serial-number.
The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify that the product-serial-number contained in the IDevID EE certificate of the pledge matches the serial-number value in the PVR.
In addition, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be equal to the serial-number value contained in the agent-signed data of PVR.</t>
  <t>assertion: contains the voucher assertion requested the pledge (agent-proximity).
The registrar provides this information to assure successful verification of agent proximity based on the agent-signed-data.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The voucher can be optionally enhanced with the following additional parameter as defined in <xref target="voucher-request-prm-yang"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-sign-cert: Contain the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data if MASA verification of agent-proximity is required to provide the assertion "agent-proximity".</t>

<t>The object is signed using the registrar LDevID(Reg) credential, which corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.</t>

<t>In addition, the following additional processing <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be done for components contained in the prior-signed-voucher-request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: The MASA <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> verify that this field contains the LDevID(Reg) certificate.
If so, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be consistent with the certificate used to sign the registrar-voucher-request.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: The MASA <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> verify this field to be able to provide "agent-proximity" assertion.
If so, the agent-signed-data <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the pledge product-serial-number, contained in the serial-number properties of the prior-signed-voucher and also in serial-number properties of  the registrar-voucher-request.
The LDevID(RegAgt) EE certificate used to generate the signature is identified by the "kid" parameter of the JOSE header (agent-signed-data).
If the assertion "agent-proximity" is requested, the registrar-voucher-request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the corresponding LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data in the agent-sign-cert, which can be verified by the MASA as issued by the same domain CA as the LDevID(Reg) EE certificate.<br />
If the agent-sign-cert information is not provided, the MASA <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> provide a lower level assertion "logged" or "verified".<br />
Note, in case the LDevID(RegAgt) EE certificate is issued by a sub-CA and not the domain CA known to the MASA, sub-CA certificate(s) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be presented in the agent-sign-cert.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If validation fails, the MASA <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with an HTTP error code to the registrar.
The error codes are kept as defined in section 5.6 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>, <!-- XXX -->and comprise the response codes 403, 404, 406, and 415.</t>

<t>The voucher response format is as indicated in the submitted Accept header fields or based on the MASA's prior understanding of proper format for this pledge.
Specifically for the pledge-responder-mode the "application/voucher-jws+json" as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> is applied.
The syntactic details of vouchers are described in detail in <xref target="RFC8366"/>. <xref target="MASA-vr"/> shows an example of the contents of a voucher.</t>

<t>The MASA sends the voucher in the indicated form to the registrar.
After receiving the voucher the registrar may evaluate the voucher for transparency and logging purposes as outlined in section 5.6 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The registrar forwards the voucher without changes to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t>After receiving the voucher, the registrar-agent sends the pledge's enrollment-request to the registrar.
Deviating from BRSKI the enrollment-request is not a raw PKCS#10 request.
As the registrar-agent is involved in the exchange, the PKCS#10 is contained in the JOSE object. The signature is created using the pledge's IDevID to provide proof-of-identity as outlined in <xref target="per"/>.</t>

<t>When using EST, the registrar-agent sends the enrollment request to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST at the endpoint "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll".</t>

<t>The enrollment-request Content-Type is: <spanx style="verb">application/jose</spanx></t>

<t>If validation of the wrapping signature fails, the registrar <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> respond with the HTTP 404 error code.
If the voucher-request is in an unknown format, then an HTTP 406 error code is more appropriate.
A situation that could be resolved with administrative action (such as adding a vendor/manufacturer IDevID CA as trusted party) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be responded with an 403 HTTP error code.</t>

<t>This results in a deviation from the content types used in <xref target="RFC7030"/> and results in additional processing at the domain registrar as EST server as following.
Note that the registrar is already aware that the bootstrapping is performed in a pledge-responder-mode due to the use of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate in the TLS establishment and the provided pledge-voucher-request in JOSE object.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>If registrar receives the enrollment-request with the Content Type application/jose, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> verify the signature using the certificate indicated in the JOSE header.</t>
  <t>The domain registrar verifies that the serial-number contained in the pledge's IDevID certificate contained in the JOSE header as being accepted to join the domain, based on the verification of the pledge-voucher-request.</t>

<t>The credential used by the registrar-agent to sign the data for the pledge in case of the pledge-initiator-mode should not contain personal information.
Therefore, it is recommended to use an LDevID certificate associated with the device instead of a potential service technician operating the device, to avoid revealing this information to the MASA.</t>

<section anchor="misuse-of-acquired-voucher-and-enrollment-responses-by-registrar-agent"><name>Misuse of acquired Voucher and Enrollment responses by Registrar-Agent</name>

<t>A Registrar-agent that uses acquired voucher and enrollment response for domain 1 in domain 2 can be detected by the pledge-voucher-request processing on the domain registrar side.
This requires the domain registrar to verify the proximity-registrar-cert leaf in the pledge-voucher-request against his own LDevID.
In addition, the domain registrar has to verify the association of the pledge to his domain based on the product-serial-number contained in the pledge-voucher-request.</t>

<t>Misbinding of pledge by a faked domain registrar is countered as described in BRSKI security considerations (section 11.4).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="misuse-of-registrar-agent-credentials"><name>Misuse of Registrar-Agent Credentials</name>

<t>Concerns have been raised, that there may be opportunities to misuse the registrar-agent with a valid LDevID.
This may be addressed by utilizing short-lived certificates (e.g., valid for a day) to authenticate the registrar-agent against the domain registrar.
The LDevID certificate for the registrar-agent may be provided by a prior BRSKI execution based on an existing IDevID.
Alternatively, the LDevID may be acquired by a service technician after authentication against the issuing CA.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="yang-module-security-considerations"><name>YANG Module Security Considerations</name>

<t>The enhanced voucher-request described in section <xref target="voucher-request-prm-yang"/> bases on <xref target="RFC8995"/>, but uses a different encoding, based on <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.
Therefore, similar considerations as described in Section 11.7 (Security Considerations) of <xref target="RFC8995"/> apply.
The YANG module specified in this document defines the schema for data that is subsequently encapsulated by a JOSE signed-data content type, as described <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.
As such, all of the YANG-modeled data is protected from modification.
The use of YANG to define data structures, via the "yang-data" statement, is relatively
new and distinct from the traditional use of YANG to define an API accessed by network management protocols such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.
For this reason, these guidelines do not follow the template described by Section 3.7 of <xref target="RFC8407"/>.</t>

<abstract><t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.  In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including, but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server is useful.</t><t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.  In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names.</t><t>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t></abstract>

	 <t>   [RFC8366] defines a digital artifact called voucher as a YANG-defined
   JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) structure.  This memo introduces a variant of the
   voucher structure in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing
   and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described in [RFC7515] to better
   support use-cases in which JOSE is preferred over CMS.

   In addition to explaining how the format is created, MIME types are
   registered and examples are provided.

	 <t>   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   pledge&#39;s manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a &quot;voucher&quot;.

   This document defines an artifact format as a YANG-defined JSON
   document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) structure.  Other YANG-derived formats are possible.  The
   voucher artifact is normally generated by the pledge&#39;s manufacturer
   (i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA)).

   This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other
   documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.

  <t>Fixed "serial-number" in PVR/RVR, Note for sub-CA information to agent-signed-data, agent-sign-cert writings.</t>
  <t>Inclusion of limitation section (pledge sleeps and needs to be waked up. Pledge is awake but registrar-agent is not available).</t>
  <t>Assertion-type aligned with voucher in RFC8366bis, deleted related open issues</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 -&gt; IETF anima-brski-prm-00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode from
draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 to this document
This required changes and adaptations in several sections to remove
the description and references to UC1.</t>
  <t>Addressed feedback for voucher-request enhancements from YANG doctor
early review in <xref target="voucher-request-prm-yang"/> as well as in the
security considerations (formerly named ietf-async-voucher-request).</t>
  <t>Renamed ietf-async-voucher-request to IETF-voucher-request-prm to
to allow better listing of voucher related extensions; aligned with
constraint voucher (#20)</t>
  <t>Utilized ietf-voucher-request-async instead of ietf-voucher-request
in voucher exchanges to utilize the enhanced voucher-request.</t>
  <t>Included changes from draft-ietf-netconf-sztp-csr-06 regarding the
YANG definition of csr-types into the enrollment request exchange.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 02 -&gt; IETF draft 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_1"/> as voucher-request was
enhanced with additional leaf.</t>
  <t>Included open issues in YANG model in <xref target="uc2"/> regarding assertion
value agent-proximity and csr encapsulation using SZTP sub module).</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 01 -&gt; IETF draft 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
remaining objects with this approach in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/> .</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -&gt; registrar-agent to
better underline agent relation.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -&gt; pledge-initiator-mode
and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.</t>
  <t>Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in <xref target="uc2"/>.</t>
  <t>Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
the security considerations.</t>
  <t>Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
in agent signed data (issue #11).</t>
  <t>Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
(issue #1) in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/>.</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
pledge (issue #5) included in <xref target="uc2"/>.</t>
  <t>Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in <xref target="exchanges_uc2"/>.</t>

  <t>Update of scope in <xref target="sup-env"/> to include in
which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 in <xref target="uc2"/> to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.</t>
  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints do not
result in additional /.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.</t>
  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
new section as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>
  <t>Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
pledge-agent use case <xref target="uc2"/>, e.g. to
accommodate distribution of CA certificates.</t>
  <t>Updated CMP example in to use lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
the necessary /.well-known endpoints.</t>
  <t>Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
<xref target="req-sol"/>. Shortened description of proof
of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.</t>
  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in UC1 to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an offsite PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-PRM call flow.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 01 -&gt; 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
IDevID and LDevID.</t>
  <t>Update of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>

<t>From individual version 00 -&gt; 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in <xref target="req-sol"/>.</t>
  <t>New section starting with the
mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
boundary conditions.</t>

--- abstract

This document defines enhancements to bootstrapping a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI, {{RFC8995}}) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar.
It specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model changes from a pledge-initiator-mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge-responder-mode as described in this document.
To support both, BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar-agent component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase.
For the establishment of a trust relation between pledge and domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (signature-wrapped objects).
The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the domain registrar to communicate with the Domain CA.

# Introduction
BRSKI as defined in {{RFC8995}} specifies a solution for secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrapping of devices (pledges) in a (customer) site domain.
This includes the discovery of network elements in the customer site/domain and the exchange of security information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the domain.  

Security information about the customer site/domain, specifically the customer site/domain certificate, is exchanged utilizing voucher requests and voucher responses as defined in {{RFC8366}}.
These vouchers are signed objects, provided via the domain registrar to the pledge and originate from a Manufacturer's Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).

BRSKI addresses scenarios in which the pledge acts as client for the bootstrapping and is the initiator of the bootstrapping (this document refers to the approach as pledge-initiator-mode).
In industrial environments the pledge may behave as a server and thus does not initiate the bootstrapping with the domain registrar.
In this scenarios it is expected that the pledge will be triggered to generate requests to be bootstrapped in the customer site/domain (this document refers to the approach as pledge-responder-mode).
For this, an additional component is introduced acting as an agent for the domain registrar (registrar-agent) towards the pledge.
This may be a functionality of a commissioning or configuration tool or it may be even co-located with the registrar.  

In contrast to BRSKI the registrar-agent facilitates the data exchange with the pledge and provides/retrieves data objects to/from the domain registrar.
For the interaction with the domain registrar the registrar-agent will use existing BRSKI {{RFC8995}} endpoints.

The term endpoint used in the context of this document is similar to resources in CoAP {{RFC7252}} and also in HTTP {{RFC9110}}. It is not used to describe a device. Endpoints are accessible via .well-known URIs.

The goal is to enhance BRSKI to support pledges in responder mode.
This is addressed by

* introducing the registrar-agent as new component to facilitate the communication between the pledge and the registrar, if the pledge is in responder mode (acting as server).

* handling the security on application layer only to enable application of arbitrary transport means between the pledge and the domain registrar, by keeping the registrar-agent in the communication path.
  Examples may be connectivity via IP based networks (wired or wireless) but also connectivity via Bluetooth or NFC between the pledge and the registrar-agent.  

* allowing to utilize credentials different from the pledge's IDevID to establish a TLS connection to the domain registrar, which is necessary in case of using a registrar-agent.

* defining the interaction (data exchange and data objects) between a pledge acting as server and a registrar-agent and the domain registrar.

For the enrollment of devices BRSKI relies on EST {{RFC7030}} to request and distribute customer site/domain specific device certificates.
EST in turn relies on a binding of the certification request to an underlying TLS connection between the EST client and the EST server.
According to BRSKI the domain registrar acts as EST server and is also acting as registration authority (RA) for its domain.
To utilize the EST server endpoints on the domain-registrar, the registrar-agent defined in this document will act as client towards the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent will also act as client when communicating with the pledge in responder mode. 
Here, TLS with server-side, certificate-based authentication is not directly applicable, as the pledge only possesses an IDevID certificate, which does not contain a subject alternative name (SAN) for the customer site/domain and does also not contain a TLS server flag. 
This is one reason for relying on higher layer security by using signature wrapped objects for the exchange between the pledge and the registrar agent. 
A further reason is the application on different transports, for which TLS may not be available, like Bluetooth or NFC.
Instead of using TLS to provide secure transport between the pledge and the registrar-agent, BRSKI-PRM will rely on an additional wrapping signature of the enrollment request by the pledge. For EST {{RFC7030}} the registrar then needs to do additional pre-processing by verifying this signature, which is not present in EST.
  


# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document relies on the terminology defined in {{RFC8995}}, section 1.2.
The following terms are defined additionally:

authenticated self-contained object:
: Describes an object, which is cryptographically bound to the end entity (EE) certificate (IDevID certificate or LDEVID certificate).
  The binding is assumed to be provided through a digital signature of the actual object using the corresponding private key of the EE certificate.  

CA:
: Certification authority, issues certificates.

Commissioning tool:
: Tool to interact with devices to provide configuration data 

CSR:
: Certificate Signing Request
EE:
: End entity

mTLS:
: Mutual authenticated Transport Layer Security.

on-site:
: Describes a component or service or functionality available in the customer site/domain.

off-site:
: Describes a component or service or functionality not available in the customer site/domain.
  This may be a central site or a cloud service, to which only a temporary connection is available, or which is in a different administrative domain.
   
PER:
: Pledge-enrollment-request is a signature wrapped CSR, signed by the pledge that requests to enroll in a domain

POP:
: Proof of possession (of a private key)

POI:
: Proof of identity 

PVR:
: Pledge-voucher-request is a voucher request signed by the pledge that requests to be part of a domain

RA:
: Registration authority, an optional system component to which a CA delegates certificate management functions such as authorization checks.

RER:
: Registrar-enrollment-request is the PER send to the CA by the registrar 

RVR:
: Registrar-voucher-request is a request containing the PVR sent to the MASA 


# Scope of Solution

## Supported Environments and Use Case Examples {#sup-env}

BRSKI-PRM is applicable to environments where pledges may have different behavior: pledge-responder-mode, or pledges may have no direct connection to the domain registrar. Either way pledges are expected to be managed by the same registrar.
This can be motivated by pledges deployed in environments not yet connected to the operational customer site/domain network, e.g., at construction time. 
Another environment relates to the assembly of cabinets, which are prepared in advance to be installed on a customer site/domain. 
As there is no direct connection to the registrar available in these environments the solution specified allows the pledges to act in a server role so they can be triggered for bootstrapping e.g., by a commissioning tool. As BRSKI focuses on the pledge in a client role, initiating the bootstrapping (pledge-initiator-mode), BRSKI-PRM defines pledges acting as a server (pledge-responder-mode) responding to PVR and PER and consumption of the results.  

The following examples motivate support of BRSKI-PRM to support pledges acting as server as well as pledges with limited connectivity to the registrar.

While BRSKI-PRM defines support for pledges in responder mode, there may be pledges, which can act in both modes, initiator and responder. 
In these cases BRSKI-PRM can be combined with BRSKI as defined in {{RFC8995}} or BRSKI-AE {{I-D.ietf-anima-brski-ae}} to allow for more bootstrapping flexibility. 
Once a pledge with such combined functionality has been bootstrapped, it may act as client for enrollment or re-enrollment of further certificates needed, e.g., using the enrollment protocol of choice. 
If it still acts as server, the defined endpoints can be used to trigger a PER for further certificates. 


### Building Automation

In building automation a typical use case exists where a detached building (or a cabinet) or the basement of a building is equipped with sensors, actuators and controllers, but with only limited or no connection to the central building management system.
This limited connectivity may exist during installation time or also during operation time.
During the installation in the basement, a service technician collects the device specific information from the basement network and provides them to the central building management system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile device to transport the information.
A domain registrar may be part of the central building management system and already be operational in the installation network.
The central building management system can then provide operational parameters for the specific devices in the basement.
This operational parameters may comprise values and settings required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, among them a certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other components and services.
These operational parameters are then provided to the devices in the basement facilitated by the service technician's laptop.


### Infrastructure Isolation Policy

This refers to any case in which the network infrastructure is normally isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for security reasons.
In such a case, limited access to a domain registrar may be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of time, for example when a batch of new devices are deployed, but prohibited at other times.


### Less Operational Security in the Target-Domain

The registration authority (RA) performing the authorization of a certificate request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher operational security than other components utilizing the issued certificates .
CAs may also require higher security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser {{CABF}} forum increases the security requirements in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be situations in which the customer site/domain does not offer enough security to operate a RA/CA and therefore this service is transferred to a backend that offers a higher level of operational security.


## Limitations

The mechanism described in this document presume the availability of the pledge to communicate with the registrar-agent.  
This may not be possible in constrained environments where, in particular, power must be conserved.  
In these situations, it is anticipated that the transceiver will be powered down most of the time.  
This presents a rendezvous problem: the pledge is unavailable for certain periods of time, and the registrar-agent is similarly presumed to be unavailable for certain periods of time.  


# Requirements Discussion and Mapping to Solution-Elements {#req-sol}

Based on the intended target environment described in {{sup-env}} and the application examples described in {{sup-env}} the following requirements are derived to support bootstrapping of pledges in responder mode (acting as server).

* To facilitate the communication between a pledge in responder mode and registrar, additional functionality is needed either on the registrar (if the registrar needs to interact with pledge in responder mode directly) or as a stand-alone component. 
  This component acts as an agent of the registrar to trigger the pledge to generate requests for voucher and enrollment. These requests are than to be provided by the so called registrar-agent to the registrar.
  This requires the definition of endpoints on the pledge.  
  
* The communication between the registrar-agent and the pledge MUST not rely on transport layer security (TLS) to support also other technology stacks (e.g., BTLE). 
  Therefore authenticated self-contained objects are required. 
  
* The registrar-agent must be authenticated by the registrar as a component, acting on behalf of the registrar. 
  In addition the registrar must be able to verify, which registrar-agent was in direct contact with the pledge. 
  
* The pledge cannot get the assertion with value "proximity" in the voucher, as it was not in direct contact with the registrar for bootstrapping. 
  Therefore the "agent-proximity" assertion value is necessary for distinguishing assertions the MASA can state.

At least the following properties are required for the voucher request and response processing as well as the enrollment:

* Proof of Identity (POI): provides data-origin authentication of a data object, e.g., a voucher request or an enrollment request, utilizing an existing IDevID.
  Certificate updates may utilize the certificate that is to be updated.

* Proof of Possession (POP): proves that an entity possesses and controls the private key corresponding to the public key contained in the  certification request, typically by adding a signature using the private key to the certification request.

Solution examples based on existing technology are provided with the focus on existing IETF RFCs:

* Voucher requests and responses as used in {{RFC8995}} already provide both, POP and POI, through a digital signature to protect the integrity of the voucher, while the corresponding signing certificate contains the identity of the signer.

* Certification requests are data structures containing the information from a requester for a CA to create a certificate. 
  The certification request format in BRSKI is PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}}.
  In PKCS#10, the structure is signed to ensure integrity protection and proof of possession of the private key of the requester that corresponds to the contained public key.
  In the application examples, this POP alone is not sufficient. POI is also required for the certification request and therefore needs to be additionally bound to the existing credential of the pledge (IDevID).
  This binding supports the authorization decision for the certification request through a proof of identity (POI).
  The binding of data origin authentication or POI to the certification request may be provided directly by with the certification request.
  While BRSKI uses the binding to TLS, BRSKI-PRM aims at an additional signature of the PKCS#10  using existing credentials on the pledge (IDevID). This ensures independence of the selected transport.


# Architectural Overview and Communication Exchanges {#architecture}

For BRSKI with pledge in responder mode, the base system architecture defined in BRSKI {{RFC8995}} is enhanced to facilitate the new use cases.
The pledge-responder-mode allows delegated bootstrapping using a registrar-agent instead of a direct connection between the pledge and the domain registrar.
The communication model between registrar-agent and pledge in this document assumes that the pledge is acting as server and responds to requests.

Necessary enhancements to support authenticated self-contained objects for certificate enrollment are kept at a minimum to enable reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.

For the authenticated self-contained objects used for the certification request, BRSKI-PRM relies on the defined message wrapping mechanisms of the enrollment protocols stated in {{req-sol}} above.

The security used within the document for bootstrapping objects produced or consumed by the pledge bases on JOSE {{RFC7515}}. In constraint environments it may provided based on COSE {{RFC8152}}.

An abstract overview of the BRSKI-PRM protocol can be found in  {{BRSKI-PRM-abstract}}.


## Pledge-responder-mode (PRM): Registrar-agent Communication with Pledges {#uc2}

To support mutual trust establishment between the domain registrar and pledges not directly connected to the customer site/domain, this document specifies the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (the voucher request/response as known from BRSKI and the enrollment request/response as introduced by BRSKI-PRM) with the help of a registrar-agent.
This allows independence from protection provided by the utilized transport protocol.

The registrar-agent may be implemented as an integrated functionality of a commissioning tool or be co-located with the registrar itself.
This leads to extensions of the logical components in the BRSKI architecture as shown in {{uc2figure}}. 
Note that the Join Proxy is neglected in the figure as not needed by the registrar-agent.
The registrar-agent interacts with the pledge to transfer the required data objects for bootstrapping, which are then also exchanged between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
The addition of the registrar-agent influences the sequences of the data exchange between the pledge and the domain registrar as described in {{RFC8995}}.
To enable reuse of BRSKI defined functionality as much as possible, BRSKI-PRM:
 
* uses existing endpoints were the required functionality is provided
* enhances existing with new supported media types, e.g., for JWS voucher 
* defines new endpoints were additional functionality is required, e.g., for wrapped certification request.

{: #uc2figure title='Architecture overview using registrar-agent' artwork-align="left"}

For authentication to the domain registrar, the registrar-agent uses its LDevID(RegAgt).
The provisioning of the registrar-agent LDevID is out of scope for this document, but may be done in advance using a separate BRSKI run or by other means like configuration.  
It is recommended to use short lived registrar-agent LDevIDs in the range of days or weeks as outlined in {{sec_cons_reg-agt}}. 

If a registrar detects a request that originates from a registrar-agent it is able to switch the operational mode from BRSKI to BRSKI-PRM.
This may be supported by a specific naming in the SAN (subject alternative name) component of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate. 
Alternatively, the domain may feature an own issuing CA for registrar-agent LDevID certificates. 
This allows the registrar to detect registrar-agents based on the issuing CA. 

The following list describes the components in a (customer) site domain:

* Pledge: The pledge is expected to respond with the necessary data objects for bootstrapping to the registrar-agent.
  The protocol used between the pledge and the registrar-agent is assumed to be HTTP in the context of this document.
  Other protocols may be used like CoAP, Bluetooth, or NFC, but are out of scope of this document.
  A pledge acting as a server during bootstrapping leads to some differences to BRSKI:

  * Discovery of the pledge by the registrar-agent must be possible.

  * As the registrar-agent must be able to request data objects for bootstrapping of the pledge, the pledge must offer corresponding endpoints.

  * The registrar-agent may provide additional data to the pledge in the context of the voucher triggering request, to make itself visible to the domain registrar. 

  * Order of exchanges in the call flow may be different as the registrar-agent collects both, PVR and PER, at once and provides them to the registrar.
    This approach may also be used to perform a bulk bootstrapping of several devices.

  * The data objects utilized for the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar are self-contained authenticated objects (signature-wrapped objects).


* Registrar-agent: provides a communication path to exchange data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar.
  The registrar-agent brokers in situations, in which the domain registrar is not directly reachable by the pledge, either due to a different technology stack or due to missing connectivity.
  The registrar-agent triggers a pledge to create bootstrapping artifacts such as voucher-request and enrollment-request on one or multiple pledges and performs a (bulk) bootstrapping based on the collected data.
  The registrar-agent is expected to possess information of the domain registrar (i.e., LDevID(Reg) certificate, LDevID(CA) certificate, address), either by configuration or by using the discovery mechanism defined in {{RFC8995}}.
  There is no trust assumption between the pledge and the registrar-agent as only authenticated self-contained objects are used, which are transported via the registrar-agent and provided either by the pledge or the registrar.
  The trust assumption between the registrar-agent and the registrar is based on the LDevID of the registrar-agent, provided by the PKI responsible for the domain.  
  This allows the registrar-agent to authenticate towards the registrar, e.g., in a TLS handshake.
  Based on this, the registrar is able to distinguish a pledge from a registrar-agent during the session establishment and also to verify that the registrar-agent is authorized to perform the bootstrapping of the distinct pledge.

* Join Proxy (not shown): same functionality as described in {{RFC8995}} if needed.
  Note that a registrar-agent may use a join proxy to facilitate the TLS connection to the registrar, in the same way that a BRSKI pledge would use a join proxy. This is useful in cases where the registrar-agent does not have full IP connectivity via the domain network, or cases where it has no other means to locate the registrar on the network.

* Domain Registrar: In general the domain registrar fulfills the same functionality regarding the bootstrapping of the pledge in a (customer) site domain by facilitating the communication of the pledge with the MASA service and the domain PKI service.
  In contrast to {{RFC8995}}, the domain registrar does not interact with a pledge directly but through the registrar-agent.
  The registrar detects if the bootstrapping is performed by the pledge directly or by the registrar-agent.
The manufacturer provided components/services (MASA and Ownership tracker) are used as defined in {{RFC8995}}.
For issuing a voucher, the MASA may perform additional checks on a voucher-request, to issue a voucher indicating agent-proximity instead of (registrar-)proximity.

## Agent-Proximity Assertion {#agt_prx}

"Agent-proximity" is a weaker assertion then "proximity".
It is defined as additional assertion type in {{I-D.ietf-anima-rfc8366bis}}
"agent-proximity" is a statement, that the proximity registrar certificate was provided via the registrar-agent as defined in {{exchanges_uc2}} and not directly to the pledge.
This can be verified by the registrar and also by the MASA during the voucher-request processing.
Note that at the time of creating the voucher-request, the pledge cannot verify the registrar's LDevID(Reg) certificate and has no proof-of-possession of the corresponding private key for the certificate. 
The pledge therefore accepts the LDevID(Reg) provisionally until it receives the voucher as described in  {{exchanges_uc2_3}}.

Trust handover to the domain is established via the "pinned-domain-certificate" in the voucher.

In contrast, "proximity" provides a statement, that the pledge was in direct contact with the registrar and was able to verify proof-of-possession of the private key in the context of the TLS handshake.
The provisionally accepted LDevID(Reg) certificate can be verified after the voucher has been processed by the pledge. 
As the returned voucher includes an additional signature by the registrar, the pledge can also verify that the registrar possesses the corresponding private key.   

## Behavior of Pledge in Pledge-Responder-Mode {#pledge_ep}

In contrast to BRSKI the pledge acts as server.
It is triggered by the registrar-agent for the generation of the PVR and PER as well as for the processing of the responses and the generation of status information.
Due to the use of the registrar-agent, the interaction with the domain registrar is changed as shown in {{exchangesfig_uc2_1}}.
To enable interaction with the registrar-agent, the pledge provides endpoints using the BRSKI defined endpoints based on the "/.well-known/brski" URI tree.

The following endpoints are defined for the *pledge* in this document. 
The URI path begins with "http://www.example.com/.well-known/brski" followed by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation.

## Behavior of Registrar-Agent

The registrar-agent is a new component in the BRSKI context.
It provides connectivity between the pledge and the domain registrar and reuses the endpoints of the domain registrar side already specified in {{RFC8995}}.
It facilitates the exchange of data between the pledge and the domain registrar, which are the voucher request/response, the enrollment request/response, as well as related status information.
For the communication with the pledge the registrar-agent utilizes communication endpoints provided by the pledge.
The transport in this specification is based on HTTP but may also be done using other transport mechanisms.
This new component changes the general interaction between the pledge and the domain registrar as shown in {{uc2figure}}. 

The registrar-agent is expected to already possess an LDevID(RegAgt) to authenticate to the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent will use this LDevID(RegAgt) when establishing the TLS session with the domain registrar for TLS client authentication.
The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate MUST include a SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID), which is used as reference in the context of an agent-signed-data object as defined in {{exchanges_uc2_1}}.
Note that this is an additional requirement for issuing the certificate, as {{IEEE-802.1AR}} only requires the SKID to be included for intermediate CA certificates.
In BRSKI-PRM, the SKID is used in favor of a certificate fingerprint to avoid additional computations.

Using an LDevID for TLS client authentication is a deviation from {{RFC8995}}, in which the pledge's IDevID credential is used to perform TLS client authentication.
The use of the LDevID(RegAgt) allows the domain registrar to distinguish, if bootstrapping is initiated from a pledge or from a registrar-agent and adopt the internal handling accordingly.
As BRSKI-PRM uses authenticated self-contained data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar, the binding of the pledge identity to the requests is provided by the data object signature employing the pledge's IDevID.
The objects exchanged between the pledge and the domain registrar used in the context of this specifications are JOSE objects.

In addition to the LDevID(RegAgt), the registrar-agent is provided with the product-serial-numbers of the pledges to be bootstrapped.
This is necessary to allow the discovery of pledges by the registrar-agent using mDNS.
The list may be provided by administrative means or the registrar agent may get the information via an interaction with the pledge. For instance, {{RFC9238}} describes scanning of a QR code, the product-serial-number would be initialized from the 12N B005 Product Serial Number.

According to {{RFC8995}} section 5.3, the domain registrar performs the pledge authorization for bootstrapping within his domain based on the pledge voucher-request object.

The following information must therefore be available at the registrar-agent:

* LDevID(RegAgt): own operational key pair.

* LDevID(reg) certificate: certificate of the domain registrar.

* Serial-number(s): product-serial-number(s) of pledge(s) to be bootstrapped.


### Discovery of Registrar by Registrar-Agent {#discovery_uc2_reg}

The discovery of the domain registrar may be done as specified in {{RFC8995}} with the
deviation that it is done between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
Alternatively, the registrar-agent may be configured with the address of the domain registrar and the certificate of the domain registrar.


### Discovery of Pledge by Registrar-Agent {#discovery_uc2_ppa}

The discovery of the pledge by registrar-agent should be done by using DNS-based Service Discovery {{RFC6763}} over Multicast DNS {{RFC6762}} to discover the pledge. The pledge constructs a local host name based on device local information (product-serial-number), which results in "product-serial-number._brski-pledge._tcp.local".

The registrar-agent MAY use

* "product-serial-number._brski-pledge._tcp.local", to discover a specific pledge, e.g., when connected to a local network. 
* "_brski-pledge._tcp.local" to get a list of pledges to be bootstrapped.

To be able to detect the pledge using mDNS, network connectivity is required. For Ethernet it is provided by simply connecting the network cable. For WIFI networks, connectivity can be provided by using a pre-agreed SSID for bootstrapping. The same approach can be used by 6LoWPAN/mesh using a pre-agreed PAN ID. How to gain network connectivity is out of scope of this document.


## Bootstrapping Data Objects and Corresponding Exchanges {#exchanges_uc2}

The interaction of the pledge with the registrar-agent may be accomplished using different transport means (protocols and or network technologies).
For this document the usage of HTTP is targeted as in BRSKI.
Alternatives may be CoAP, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or Nearfield Communication (NFC).
This requires independence of the exchanged data objects between the pledge and the registrar from transport security.
These transport means may differ from, and are independent from, the ones used between the registrar-agent and the registrar.
Therefore, authenticated self-contained objects (here: signature-wrapped objects) are applied in the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar.

The registrar-agent provides the domain-registrar certificate (LDevID(Reg) certificate) to the pledge to be included into the "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate" leaf of the PVR.
This enables the registrar to verify, that it is the target registrar for handling the request.
The registrar certificate may be configured at the registrar-agent or may be fetched by the registrar-agent based on a prior TLS connection establishment with the domain registrar.
In addition, the registrar-agent provides agent-signed-data containing the product-serial-number in the body, signed with the LDevID(RegAgt).
This enables the registrar to verify and log, which registrar-agent was in contact with the pledge, when verifying the PVR.
Optionally the registrar-agent may provide its LDevID(RegAgt) certificate (and optionally also the issuing CA certificate) to the pledge to be used in the "agent-sign-cert" component of the PVR. If contained, the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate MUST be the first certificate in the array.
Note, this may be omitted in constraint environments to save bandwidth between the registrar-agent and the pledge.
If not contained, the registrar MUST fetch the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate based on the SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) in the header of the agent-signed-data of the PVR.
The registrar includes the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate information into the RVR if the PVRs contains the assertion of "agent-proximity".

The MASA in turn verifies the LDevID(Reg) certificate is included in the PVR (prior-signed-voucher-request) in the "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate" leaf and may assert in the voucher "verified" or "logged" instead of "proximity", as there is no direct connection between the pledge and the registrar. 
In addition, the MASA can provide the assertion "agent-proximity" as following.
If the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate information is contained in the "agent-sign-cert" component of the RVR, the MASA can verify the signature of the agent-signed-data contained in the prior-signed-voucher-request.
If both can be verified successfully, the MASA can assert "agent-proximity" in the voucher. Otherwise, it may assert "verified" or "logged". 
Depending on the MASA verification policy, it may also respond with a suitable 4xx or 5xx status code as described in section 5.6 of {{RFC8995}}.  
The voucher can then be supplied via the registrar to the registrar-agent.

{{exchangesfig_uc2_all}} provides an overview of the exchanges detailed in the following sub sections.

The following sub sections split the interactions between the different components into:

* {{exchanges_uc2_1}} describes data exchanged between the registrar-agent and the pledge.

* {{exchanges_uc2_2}} describes data exchanged between the registrar-agent and the registrar and also the interaction of the registrar with the MASA and the domain CA.

* {{exchanges_uc2_3}} describes data exchanged between the registrar-agent and the pledge including the status information.

* {{exchanges_uc2_4}} describes the status handling addresses the exchanges between the registrar-agent and the registrar.


###  Request Objects Acquisition by Registrar-Agent from Pledge {#exchanges_uc2_1}

The following description assumes that the registrar-agent already discovered the pledge.
This may be done as described in {{discovery_uc2_ppa}} based on mDNS.

The focus is on the exchange of signature-wrapped objects using endpoints defined for the pledge in {{pledge_ep}}.

Preconditions:

* Pledge: possesses IDevID

* Registrar-agent: possesses/trusts IDevID CA certificate and an own LDevID(RegAgt) credential for the registrar domain.
  In addition, the registrar-agent MUST know the product-serial-number(s) of the pledge(s) to be bootstrapped. 
  The registrar-agent MAY be provided with the product-serial-number in different ways:
  * configured, e.g., as a list of pledges to be bootstrapped via QR code scanning
  * discovered by using standard approaches like mDNS as described in {{discovery_uc2_ppa}}
  * discovered by using a vendor specific approach, e.g., RF beacons

* Registrar: possesses/trusts IDevID CA certificate and an own LDevID(Reg) credential.

Note that the registrar-agent may trigger the pledge for the PVR or the PER or both. It is expected that this will be aligned with a service technician workflow doing the pledge installation. 

Triggering the pledge to create the PVR is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint "/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher-request".

The registrar-agent PVR trigger Content-Type header is: `application/json`.
It defines a JSON document to provide three parameter:

* agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: base64-encoded LDevID(Reg) TLS certificate.

* agent-signed-data: base64-encoded JWS-object.

* agent-sign-cert: array of base64-encoded certificate data (optional).

The the trigger for the pledge to create a PVR is depicted in the following figure:

~~~~
{
  "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
  "agent-signed-data": "base64encodedvalue==",
  "agent-sign-cert": [
    "base64encodedvalue==", 
    "base64encodedvalue==", 
    "..."]
}
~~~~
{: #pavrt title='Representation of trigger to create PVR' artwork-align="left"}

The pledge provisionally accepts the agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert and can verify it once it has received the voucher. 
If the optionally agent-sign-cert data is included the pledge MAY verify at least the signature of the agent-signed-data using the first contained certificate, which is the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate. 
If further certificates are contained in the agent-sign-cert, they enable also the certificate chain validation.
The pledge may not verify the agent-sign-cert itself as the domain trust has not been established at this point of the communication. 
It can be done, after the voucher has been received.

The agent-signed-data is a JOSE object and contains the following information:

The header of the agent-signed-data contains:

* alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.

* kid: MUST contain the base64-encoded bytes of the SubjectKeyIdentifier (the "KeyIdentifier" OCTET STRING value), excluding the ASN.1 encoding of "OCTET STRING" of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.


The body of the agent-signed-data contains an ietf-voucher-request-prm:agent-signed-data element (defined in {{voucher-request-prm-yang}}):

* created-on: MUST contain the creation date and time in yang:date-and-time format.

* serial-number: MUST contain the product-serial-number as type string as defined in {{RFC8995}}, section 2.3.1.
  The serial-number corresponds with the product-serial-number contained in the X520SerialNumber field of the IDevID certificate of the pledge.

Upon receiving the voucher-request trigger, the pledge SHALL construct the body of the PVR as defined in {{RFC8995}}. 
It will contain additional information provided by the registrar-agent as specified in the following.
This PVR becomes a JSON-in-JWS object as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.
If the pledge is unable to construct the PVR it SHOULD respond with a HTTP error status code to the registrar-agent to indicate that it is not able to create the PVR.

The following client error status codes MAY be used:

* 400 Bad Request: if the pledge detected an error in the format of the request, e.g. missing field, wrong data types, etc. or it's not valid JSON even though the PVR media type was set to `application/json`.

* 403 Forbidden: if the pledge detected that one or more security parameters from the trigger message to create the PVR were not valid, e.g., the LDevID (Reg) certificate.

The header of the PVR SHALL contain the following parameters as defined in {{RFC7515}}:

* alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.

* x5c: contains the base64-encoded pledge IDevID certificate.
  It may optionally contain the certificate chain for this certificate.

The payload of the PVR MUST contain the following parameters as part of the ietf-voucher-request-prm:voucher as defined in {{RFC8995}}:

* created-on: SHALL contain the current date and time in yang:date-and-time format.
  If the pledge does not have synchronized the time, it SHALL use the created-on time from the agent-signed-data, received in the trigger to create a PVR.

* nonce: SHALL contain a cryptographically strong random or pseudo-random number.

* serial-number: SHALL contain the pledge product-serial-number as X520SerialNumber.

* assertion: SHALL contain the requested voucher assertion "agent-proximity". 


The ietf-voucher-request:voucher is enhanced with additional parameters:

* agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: MUST be included and contains the base64-encoded LDevID(Reg) certificate (provided as trigger parameter by the registrar-agent).

* agent-signed-data: MUST contain the base64-encoded agent-signed-data (as defined in {{asd}}) and provided as trigger parameter.

* agent-sign-cert: MAY contain the certificate or certificate chain of the registrar-agent as array of base64encoded certificate information.
  It starts from the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt) certificate optionally followed by the issuing CA certificate and potential further certificates. If supported, it MUST at least contain the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate provided as trigger parameter.

The enhancements of the YANG module for the ietf-voucher-request with these new leafs are defined in {{voucher-request-prm-yang}}.

The PVR is signed using the pledge's IDevID credential contained as x5c parameter of the JOSE header.

{: #pvr title='Representation of PVR' artwork-align="left"}

The PVR Content-Type is defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}} as `application/voucher-jws+json`.

The pledge SHOULD include this Content-Type header field indicating the included media type for the voucher response.
Note that this is also an indication regarding the acceptable format of the voucher response.
This format is included by the registrar as described in {{exchanges_uc2_2}}.

Once the registrar-agent has received the PVR it can trigger the pledge to generate a PER.
As in BRSKI the PER contains a PKCS#10, but additionally signed using the pledge's IDevID.
Note, as the initial enrollment aims to request a generic certificate, no certificate attributes are provided to the pledge.

Triggering the pledge to create the enrollment-request is done using HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint "/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment-request".

The registrar-agent PER trigger Content-Type header is: `application/json` with an empty body by default.
Note that using HTTP POST allows for an empty body, but also to provide additional data, like CSR attributes or information about the enroll type: "enroll-generic-cert" or "reenroll-generic-cert". 
The "enroll-generic-cert" case is shown in {{raer}}.

  "enroll-type" : "enroll-generic-cert"

{: #raer title='Example of trigger to create a PER' artwork-align="left"}


In the following the enrollment is described as initial enrollment with an empty HTTP POST body.

Upon receiving the enrollment-trigger, the pledge SHALL construct the PER as authenticated self-contained object.
The CSR already assures proof of possession of the private key corresponding to the contained public key.
In addition, based on the additional signature using the IDevID, proof of identity is provided.
Here, a JOSE object is being created in which the body utilizes the YANG module ietf-ztp-types with the grouping for csr-grouping for the CSR as defined in {{I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr}}.

Depending on the capability of the pledge, it constructs the enrollment request (PER) as plain PKCS#10.
Note that the focus in this use case is placed on PKCS#10 as PKCS#10 can be transmitted in different enrollment protocols in the infrastructure like EST, CMP, CMS, and SCEP. 
If the pledge is already implementing an enrollment protocol, it may leverage that functionality for the creation of the CSR.
Note also that {{I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr}} also allows for inclusion of certification requests in different formats such as CMP or CMC.

The pledge SHOULD construct the PER as PKCS#10.
In BRSKI-PRM it MUST sign it additionally with its IDevID credential to provide proof-of-identity bound to the PKCS#10 as described below.

If the pledge is unable to construct the PER it SHOULD respond with a HTTP 4xx/5xx status code to the registrar-agent to indicate that it is not able to create the PER.

The following 4xx client error status codes MAY be used:

* 400 Bad Request: if the pledge detected an error in the format of the request or detected invalid JSON even though the PER media type was set to `application/json`.

* 403 Forbidden: if the pledge detected that one or more security parameters (if provided) from the trigger message to create the PER are not valid.

* 406 Not Acceptable: if the request's Accept header indicates a type that is unknown or unsupported. For example, a type other than `application/jose+json`.

* 415 Unsupported Media Type: if the request's Content-Type header indicates a type that is unknown or unsupported. For example, a type other than 'application/json'.

A successful enrollment will result in a generic LDevID certificate for the pledge in the new domain, which can be used to request further (application specific) LDevID certificates if necessary for its operation. 
The registrar-agent SHALL use the endpoints specified in this document. 

{{I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr}} considers PKCS#10 but also CMP and CMC as certification request format. Note that the wrapping signature is only necessary for plain PKCS#10 as other request formats like CMP and CMS support the signature wrapping as part of their own certificate request format.

The registrar-agent enrollment-request Content-Type header for a wrapped PKCS#10 is: `application/jose+json`

The header of the pledge enrollment-request SHALL contain the following parameter as defined in {{RFC7515}}:

* alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.

* x5c: contains the base64-encoded pledge IDevID certificate.
  It may optionally contain the certificate chain for this certificate. 

The body of the pledge enrollment-request SHOULD contain a P10 parameter (for PKCS#10) as defined for ietf-ztp-types:p10-csr in {{I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr}}:

* P10: contains the base64-encoded PKCS#10 of the pledge.

The JOSE object is signed using the pledge's IDevID credential, which corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.

With the collected PVR and PER, the registrar-agent starts the interaction with the domain registrar.

As the registrar-agent is intended to facilitate communication between the pledge and the domain registrar, a collection of requests from more than one pledge is possible, allowing a bulk bootstrapping of multiple pledges using the same connection between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.


### Request Processing by the Registrar-Agent {#exchanges_uc2_2}

The BRSKI-PRM bootstrapping exchanges between registrar-agent and domain registrar resemble the BRSKI exchanges between pledge and domain registrar (pledge-initiator-mode) with some deviations.

Preconditions:

* Registrar-agent: possesses it's own LDevID(RegAgt) credentials of the site domain.
  In addition, it may possess the IDevID CA certificate of the pledge vendor/manufacturer to verify the pledge certificate in the received request messages.
  It has the address of the domain registrar through configuration or by discovery, e.g., mDNS/DNSSD.
  The registrar-agent has acquired one or multiple PVR and PER.

* Registrar: possesses the IDevID CA certificate of the pledge vendor/manufacturer and an it's own LDevID(Reg) credentials of the site domain.

* MASA: possesses it's own vendor/manufacturer credentials (voucher signing key, TLS server certificate) related to pledges IDevID and MAY possess the site-specific domain CA certificate. 
  The latter is necessary to ensure that the MASA is able to verify the RVR. 
  How the MASA will get the domain CA certificate is out of scope of this document.

{: #exchangesfig_uc2_2 title='Request processing between registrar-agent and infrastructure bootstrapping services' artwork-align="left"}

The registrar-agent establishes a TLS connection with the registrar.
As already stated in {{RFC8995}}, the use of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged.
TLS 1.2 or newer is REQUIRED on the registrar-agent side.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) SHOULD be available on the registrar, but TLS 1.2 MAY be used.
TLS 1.3 (or newer) SHOULD be available on the MASA, but TLS 1.2 MAY be used.

In contrast to {{RFC8995}} TLS client authentication to the registrar is achieved by using registrar-agent LDevID(RegAgt) credentials instead of pledge IDevID credentials.
Consequently BRSKI (pledge-initiator-mode) is distinguishable from BRSKI-PRM (pledge-responder-mode) by the registrar. 
The registrar SHOULD verify that the registrar-agent is authorized to establish a connection to the registrar by TLS client authentication using LDevID(RegAgt) credentials. 
If the connection form registrar-agent to registrar is established, the authorization SHALL be verified again based on the agent-signed-data contained in the PVR. 
This ensures that the pledge has been triggered by an authorized registrar-agent. 

The registrar can receive request objects in different formats as defined in {{RFC8995}}. 
Specifically, the registrar will receive JSON-in-JWS objects generated by the pledge for voucher-request and enrollment-request (instead of BRSKI voucher-request as CMS-signed JSON and enrollment-request as PKCS#10).

The registrar-agent SHALL send the PVR by HTTP POST to the registrar endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/requestvoucher"

The Content-Type header field for JSON-in-JWS PVR is: `application/voucher-jws+json` (see {{pvr}} for the content definition), as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.

The registrar-agent SHOULD set the Accept field in the request-header indicating the acceptable Content-Type for the voucher-response.
The voucher-response Content-Type header field SHOULD be set to `application/voucher-jws+json` as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.

After receiving  the PVR from registrar-agent, the registrar SHALL perform the verification as defined in section 5.3 of {{RFC8995}}.
In addition, the registrar shall verify the following parameters from the PVR:

* agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: MUST contain registrar's own LDevID(Reg) certificate to ensure the registrar in proximity of the registrar-agent is the destination for this PVR.

* agent-signed-data: The registrar MUST verify that the agent provided data has been signed with the LDevID(RegAgt) credential indicated in the "kid" JOSE header parameter.
  If the certificate is not included in the agent-sign-cert properties of the PVR, it must be fetched out-of-band by the registrar if "agent-proximity" assertion is requested.

* agent-sign-cert: MAY contain an array of base64-encoded certificate data starting with the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.
  If contained the registrar MUST verify that the LDevID(ReAgt) certificate, used to sign the data, is still valid. 
  If the certificate is already expired, the registrar SHALL reject the request.
  Validity of used signing certificates at the time of signing the agent-signed-data is necessary to avoid that a rogue registrar-agent generates agent-signed-data objects to onboard arbitrary pledges at a later point in time, see also {{sec_cons_reg-agt}}.   
  If the agent-signed-cert is not provided, the registrar MUST fetch the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate, based on the provided SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) contained in the kid header of the agent-signed-data, and perform this verification. 
  This requires, that the registrar can fetch the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data (including intermediate CA certificates if existent) based on the SKID.


If the validation fails the registrar SHOULD respond with HTTP 404 Not Found status code to the registrar-agent.
HTTP 406 Not Acceptable status code SHOULD be used if the Content-Type indicated by the Accept header is unknown or unsupported.

If the validation succeeds, the registrar SHOULD accept the PVR to join the domain as defined in section 5.3 of {{RFC8995}}.
The registrar then establishes a TLS connection to MASA as described in section 5.4 of {{RFC8995}} to obtain a voucher for the pledge.

The registrar SHALL construct the payload of the RVR as defined in {{RFC8995}}.
The RVR encoding SHALL be JSON-in-JWS as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.

The header of the RVR SHALL contain the following parameter as defined in {{RFC7515}}:

* alg: algorithm used to create the object signature.

* x5c: contains the base64-encoded registrar LDevID certificate(s).
  It may optionally contain the certificate chain for this certificate.

The payload of the RVR MUST contain the following parameter as part of the voucher request as defined in {{RFC8995}}:

* created-on: contains the current date and time in yang:date-and-time format for the RVR creation time.

* nonce: copied form the PVR

* serial-number: contains the pledge product-serial-number.
  The registrar MUST verify that the IDevID certificate subject serialNumber of the pledge (X520SerialNumber) matches the serial-number value in the PVR.
  In addition, it MUST be equal to the serial-number value contained in the agent-signed data of PVR.

* assertion: contains the voucher assertion requested by the pledge (agent-proximity).
  The registrar provides this information to assure successful verification of agent proximity based on the agent-signed-data.
  
* prior-signed-voucher-request: contains the PVR provided by the registrar-agent.

The RVR can be enhanced optionally with the following parameter as defined in {{voucher-request-prm-yang}}:

* agent-sign-cert: contains the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate or the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate including the certificate chain.
  In the context of this document it is a JSON array of base64encoded certificate information and handled in the same way as x5c header objects. 
  
If only a single object is contained in the x5c it MUST be the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.
If multiple certificates are included in the x5c, the first MUST be the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt) certificate.
  
The MASA uses this information for verification that the registrar-agent is in proximity to the registrar to state the corresponding assertion "agent-proximity". Note that the agent-sign-cert may also be contained in the "prior-signed-voucher-request" carrying the PVR if the pledge included it. 

The object is signed using the registrar LDevID(Reg) credential, which corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.

The registrar SHALL send the RVR to the MASA endpoint by HTTP POST: "/.well-known/brski/requestvoucher"

The RVR Content-Type header field is defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}} as: `application/voucher-jws+json`

The registrar SHOULD set the Accept header of the RVR indicating the desired media type for the voucher-response.
The media type is `application/voucher-jws+json` as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.

Once the MASA receives the RVR it SHALL perform the verification as described in section 5.5 in {{RFC8995}}.

In addition, the following processing SHALL be performed for PVR data contained in RVR "prior-signed-voucher-request" field:

* agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: The MASA MAY verify that this field contains the LDevID(Reg) certificate.
  If so, it MUST correspond to the LDevID(Reg) certificate used to sign the RVR.
  Note: Correspond here relates to the case that a single LDevID(Reg) certificate is used or that different LDevID(Reg) certificates are used, which are issued by the same CA.
  
* agent-signed-data: The MASA MAY verify this field to issue "agent-proximity" assertion.
  If so, the agent-signed-data MUST contain the pledge product-serial-number, contained in the "serial-number" field of the PVR (from "prior-signed-voucher-request" field) and also in "serial-number" field of the RVR.
  The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate used to generate the signature is identified by the "kid" parameter of the JOSE header (agent-signed-data).
  If the assertion "agent-proximity" is requested, the RVR MUST contain the corresponding LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data in the "agent-sign-cert" field of either the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate of RVR or of PVR from "prior-signed-voucher-request" field. 
  It MUST be verified by the MASA that it can verified the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate to the same domain CA as the LDevID(Reg) certificate.  
  If the "agent-sign-cert" field is not provided, the MASA MAY state a lower level assertion value, e.g.: "logged" or "verified"
  Note: Sub-CA certificate(s) MUST also be carried by "agent-sign-cert", in case the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate is issued by a sub-CA and not the domain CA known to the MASA. 
  As the "agent-sign-cert" field is defined as array (x5c), it can handle multiple certificates. 
  

If validation fails, the MASA SHOULD respond with an HTTP 4xx client error status code to the registrar.
The HTTP error status codes are kept the same as defined in section 5.6 of {{RFC8995}}, <!-- XXX -->and comprise the codes: 403, 404, 406, and 415.

The expected voucher-response format for the pledge-responder-mode the `application/voucher-jws+json` as defined in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}} is applied.
If the MASA detects that the Accept header of the PVR does not match the `application/voucher-jws+json` it SHOULD respond with the HTTP status code 406 Not Acceptable as the pledge will not be able to parse the response.
The voucher syntax is described in detail by {{RFC8366}}. {{MASA-vr}} shows an example of the contents of a voucher.

The MASA returns the voucher-response (voucher) to the registrar.

After receiving the voucher the registrar SHOULD evaluate it for transparency and logging purposes as outlined in section 5.6 of {{RFC8995}}.
The registrar MUST add an additional signature to the MASA provided voucher, by signing it using its registrar credentials (LDevID(Reg)). 
This signature is done over the same content as the MASA signature of the voucher and provides a proof of possession of the private key corresponding to the LDevID(Reg) the pledge received in the trigger for the PVR (see {{pavrt}}). The registrar MUST use the same LDevID(Reg) credential that is used for authentication in the TLS handshake to authenticate towards the registrar-agent. This ensures that the same LDevID(Reg) certificate can be used to verify the signature as transmitted in the voucher request as is transferred in the PVR in the agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert component. Figure {{MASA-REG-vr}} below provides an example of the voucher with two signatures.

Depending on the security policy of the operator, this signature can also be interpreted by the pledge explicit authorization of the registrar to install the contained trust anchor.
The registrar sends the voucher to the registrar-agent. 

After receiving the voucher, the registrar-agent sends the PER to the registrar.
Deviating from BRSKI the PER is not a raw PKCS#10.
As the registrar-agent is involved in the exchange, the PKCS#10 is wrapped in a JWS object by the pledge and signed with pledge's IDevID to ensure proof-of-identity as outlined in {{per}}.

{{RFC7030}} EST standard endpoints (/simpleenroll, /simplereenroll, /serverkeygen, /cacerts) on the registrar cannot be used for BRSKI-PRM. 
This is caused by the utilization of signature wrapped-objects in BRSKI-PRM. 
As EST requires to sent a raw PKCS#10 request to the /simpleenroll endpoint, this document makes an enhancement by utilizing EST but with the exception to transport a signature wrapped PKCS#10 request. 
Therefore a new endpoint for BRSKI-PRM on the registrar is defined as "/.well-known/brski/requestenroll"

The Content-Type header of PER is: `application/jose+json`.

This is a deviation from the Content-Type header values used in {{RFC7030}} and results in additional processing at the domain registrar (as EST server).
Note, the registrar is already aware that the bootstrapping is performed in a pledge-responder-mode due to the use of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate in the TLS establishment and the provided PVR as JSON-in-JWS object.

* If the registrar receives a PER with Content-Type header: `application/jose+json`, it MUST verify the wrapping signature using the certificate indicated in the JOSE header.

* The registrar verifies that the pledge's certificate (here IDevID), carried in "x5c" header field, is accepted to join the domain after successful validation of the PVR.

* If both succeed, the registrar utilizes the PKCS#10 request contained in the JWS object body as "P10" parameter of "ietf-sztp-csr:csr" for further processing of the enrollment request with the corresponding domain CA.
  It creates a registrar-enrollment-request (RER) by utilizing the protocol expected by the domain CA. 
  The domain registrar may either directly forward the provided PKCS#10 request to the CA or provide additional information about attributes to be included by the CA into the requested LDevID certificate. 
  The approach of sending this information to the CA depends on the utilized certificate management protocol between the RA and the CA and is out of scope for this document.
  
The registrar-agent SHALL send the PER to the registrar by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/requestenroll"

The registrar SHOULD respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.

A successful interaction with the domain CA will result in a pledge LDevID certificate, which is then forwarded by the registrar to the registrar-agent using the Content-Type header: `application/pkcs7-mime`.

As the pledge will verify it own certificate LDevID certificate when received, it also needs the corresponding CA certificates. 
This is done in EST using the /cacerts endpoint, which provides the CA certificates over a TLS protected connection. 
BRSKI-PRM requires a signature wrapped CA certificate response, to avoid that the pledge can be provided with arbitrary CA certificates in an authorized way. 
The additional signature of the registrar will allow the pledge to verify the authorization to install CA certificates. 
As the CA certificates are provided to the pledge after the voucher, the pledge has the necessary information to validate the provisioning object.

To allow the registrar-agent to request signature wrapped CA certificates, a new endpoint for BRSKI-PRM on the registrar is defined as "/.well-known/brski/wrappedcacerts"

The registrar-agent SHALL requests the EST CA trust anchor database information (in form of CA certificates) with an HTTPS GET message.

The Content-Type header of the response SHALL be: `application/jose+json`.

This is a deviation from the Content-Type header values used in {{RFC7030}} and results in additional processing at the domain registrar (as EST server).
The additional processing is the signature of the CA certificate information using the LDevID(Reg) credential resulting in a signed JSON object. The CA certificates are provided as base64 encoded x5b.

The registrar-agent has now finished the exchanges with the domain registrar and can supply the voucher-response (from MASA via Registrar), the CA certificates, and the enrollment-response (LDevID certificate, from CA via Registrar) to the pledge.
It can close the TLS connection to the domain registrar and can provide the responses to the pledge(s).
The content of the responses are defined by the voucher {{RFC8366}} and the certificate {{RFC5280}}.


### Response Object Supply by Registrar-Agent to Pledge {#exchanges_uc2_3}

The following description assumes that the registrar-agent has obtained the responses from the domain registrar.
It will re-start the interaction with the pledge.
To contact the pledge, it may either discover the pledge as described in {{discovery_uc2_ppa}} or use stored information from the first contact with the pledge.

Preconditions in addition to {{exchanges_uc2_2}}:

* Registrar-agent: possesses voucher and LDevID certificate and optionally CA certificates.

The registrar-agent provides the information via distinct pledge endpoints as following.

The registrar-agent SHALL send the voucher-response to the pledge by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher".

The registrar-agent voucher-response Content-Type header is `application/voucher-jws+json` and contains the voucher as provided by the MASA. An example if given in {{MASA-vr}} for a MASA only signed voucher and in Figure {{MASA-REG-vr}} for multiple signatures. 

If a single signature is contained, the pledge receives the voucher and verifies it as described in section 5.6.1 in {{RFC8995}}. 

A nonceless voucher may be accepted as in {{RFC8995}} and may be allowed by a manufactures pledge implementation.
It requires to perform the validation that the pledge is connected to an authorized registrar-agent by other means, as the registrar would be able to verify it using the agent-signed-data in the PER.

If multiple signatures are contained in the voucher, the pledge SHALL perform the signature verification in the following order:

  1. Validate MASA signature as described in section 5.6.1 in {{RFC8995}} successfully.
  2. Install contained trust anchor provisionally. 
  3. Verify registrar signature as described in section 5.6.1 in {{RFC8995}} successfully, but take the registrar certificate instead of the MASA certificate for verification.
  4. Validate the registrar certificate received in the agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert in the pledge-voucher-request trigger request (in the field "agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert") successfully, including validity and authorization to bootstrap the particular pledge. 
  
If all verification steps stated above have been performed successfully, the pledge SHALL end the provisional accept state for the domain trust anchor and the LDevID(Reg). 
If multiple signatures are contained in the voucher-response, the pledge MUST verify all successfully.

If an error occurs during the verification it SHALL be signaled in the reason field of the pledge voucher status.

After verification the pledge MUST reply with a status telemetry message as defined in section 5.7 of {{RFC8995}}.  
The pledge generates the voucher status and provides it as JOSE object with the wrapping signature in the response message to the registrar-agent.

The response has the Content-Type `application/jose+json` and is signed using the IDevID of the pledge as shown in {{vstat}}.
As the reason field is optional (see {{RFC8995}}), it MAY be omitted in case of success.

The registrar-agent SHALL provide the set of CA certificates requested from the registrar to the pledge by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/pledge-CAcerts".

As the CA certificate provisioning is crucial from a security perspective, this provisioning SHALL only be done, if the voucher-response has been successfully provided to the pledge.

The supply CA certificates message has the Content-Type `application/jose+json` and is signed using the LDevID(Reg) of the registrar pledge as shown in {{PCAC}}.

The CA certificates are provided as base64 encoded x5b.
The pledge SHALL install the received CA certificates in its trust anchor database after successful verification of the registrar's signature.  
 
If validation of the wrapping signature or another security check fails, the pledge SHOULD respond with the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code.
The HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type status code SHOULD be used, if the Content-Type of the request is in an unknown or unsupported format. 
The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code SHOULD be used, if the pledge detects errors in the encoding of the payload. 

The registrar-agent SHALL send the enroll-response to the pledge by HTTP POST to the endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment".

The registrar-agent enroll-response Content-Type header, when using EST {{RFC7030}} as enrollment protocol between the registrar-agent and the infrastructure, is `application/pkcs7-mime`. Note that it only contains the LDevID certificate for the pledge, not the certificate chain.

Upon reception, the pledge SHALL verify the received LDevID certificate. 
The pledge SHALL generate the enroll status and provide it in the response message to the registrar-agent. If the verification of the LDevID certificate succeeds, the status SHALL be set to true, otherwise to FALSE.

The pledge MUST reply with a status telemetry message as defined in section 5.9.4 of {{RFC8995}}.
As for the other objects, the enroll status is provided with an additional signature using JOSE.
If the pledge verified the received LDevID certificate successfully it SHALL sign the response using the LDevID of the pledge as shown in {{estat}}. 
In the failure case, the pledge SHALL use the available IdevID credentials.
As the reason field is optional, it MAY be omitted in case of success.

The response has the Content-Type `application/jose+json`.

{: #exchangesfig_uc2_4 title='Bootstrapping status handling' artwork-align="left"}

The registrar-agent MUST provide the collected pledge voucher status to the registrar. 
This status indicates if the pledge could process the voucher successfully or not.

If the TLS connection to the registrar was closed, the registrar-agent establishes a TLS connection with the registrar as stated in {{exchanges_uc2_2}}.

The registrar-agent sends the pledge voucher status without modification to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST using the registrar endpoint "/.well-known/brski/voucher_status". The Content-Type header is kept as `application/jose+json` as described in {{exchangesfig_uc2_3}} and depicted in the example in {{vstat}}.

The registrar SHALL verify the signature of the pledge voucher status and validate that it belongs to an accepted device in his domain based on the contained "serial-number" in the IDevID certificate referenced in the header of the voucher status.

According to {{RFC8995}} section 5.7, the registrar SHOULD respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.
The registrar-agent may use the response to signal success / failure to the service technician operating the registrar agent.
Within the server logs the server SHOULD capture this telemetry information.

The registrar SHOULD proceed with collecting and logging status information by requesting the MASA audit-log from the MASA service as described in section 5.8 of {{RFC8995}}.

The registrar-agent MUST provide the pledge's enroll status to the registrar.
The status indicates the pledge could process the enroll-response (certificate) and holds the corresponding private key.

The registrar-agent sends the pledge enroll status without modification to the registrar with an HTTP-over-TLS POST using the registrar endpoint "/.well-known/brski/enrollstatus".
The Content-Type header is kept as `application/jose+json` as described in {{exchangesfig_uc2_3}} and depicted in the example in {{estat}}.

The registrar MUST verify the signature of the pledge enroll status.
Also, the registrar SHALL validate that the pledge belongs to an accepted device in his domain based on the contained product-serial-number in the LDevID certificate referenced in the header of the enroll status. 
The registrar SHOULD log this event.
In case the pledge enroll status indicates a failure, the pledge was unable to verify the received LDevID certificate and therefore signed the enroll status with its IDevID credential.
Note that the verification of a signature of the status information is an addition to the described handling in section 5.9.4 of {{RFC8995}}.

According to {{RFC8995}} section 5.9.4, the registrar SHOULD respond with an HTTP 200 OK in the success case or fail with HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes as defined by the HTTP standard.
Based on the failure case the registrar MAY decide that for security reasons the pledge is not allowed to reside in the domain. In this case the registrar MUST revoke the certificate.
The registrar-agent may use the response to signal success / failure to the service technician operating the registrar agent.
Within the server log the registrar SHOULD capture this telemetry information.

### Request pledge-status {#exchanges_uc2_5}

The following assumes that a registrar-agent may need to query the status of a pledge. 
This information may be useful to solve errors, when the pledge was not able to connect to the target domain during the bootstrapping.
The pledge MAY provide a dedicated endpoint to accept status-requests.  

Preconditions:

* Registrar-agent: possesses LDevID (RegAgt), list of serial numbers of pledges to be queried and a list of corresponding manufacturer trust anchors to be able to verify signatures with the IDevID credential.  
* Pledge: may already possess domain credentials and LDevID(Pledge), or may not possess one or both of these.

The registrar-agent requests the pledge-status via HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint: "/.well-known/brski/pledge-status"

The registrar-agent Content-Type header for the pledge-status request is: `application/jose+json`. 
It contains information on the requested status-type, the time and date the request is created, and the product serial-number of the pledge contacted as shown in {{stat_req_def}}. 
The pledge-status request is signed by registrar-agent using the LDevID(RegAgt) credential. 

The following Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) {{RFC8610}} explains the structure of the format for the pledge-status request. It is defined following the status telemetry definitions in BRSKI {{RFC8995}}.
Consequently, format and semantics of pledge-status requests below are for version 1.  
The version field is included to permit significant changes to the pledge-status request and response in the future.  
A pledge or a registrar-agent that receives a plegde-status request with a version larger than it knows about SHOULD log the contents and alert a human.

The status-type defined for BRSKI-PRM is "bootstrap".
This indicates the pledge to provide current status information regarding the bootstrapping status (voucher processing and the enrollment of the pledge into the new domain). 
As pledge-status request is defined generic, it may be used by other specifications to request further status information, e.g., for onboarding to get further information about enrollment of application specific LDevIDs or other parameters. 
This is out of scope for this specification.

Different cases for pledge bootstrapping status may occur, which SHOULD be reflected using the status enumeration. 
The pledge-status response message is signed with IDevID or LDevID, depending on bootstrapping state of the pledge. 

* "factory-default": Pledge has not been bootstrapped. 
  The pledge signs the response message using its IDevID(Pledge).
* "vouchered": Pledge processed the voucher exchange successfully.
  The pledge signs the response message using its IDevID(Pledge).
* "enrolled": Pledge has processed the enrollment exchange successfully.
  The pledge signs the response message using its LDevID(Pledge).
* "error": Error occured during bootstrapping. 
  The reason and the reason-context SHOULD contain the telemetry information as described in section {{exchanges_uc2_3}}.  
  The pledge signs the response message using its IDevID.

In case "factory-default" the pledge does not possess the domain certificate resp. the domain trust-anchor. 
It will not be able to verify the signature of the registrar-agent in the bootstrapping-status request.
In cases "vouchered" and "enrolled" the pledge already possesses the domain certificate (has domain trust-anchore) and can therefore validate the signature of the registrar-agent. 
If validation of the JWS signature fails, the pledge SHOULD respond with the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code.
The HTTP 406 Not Acceptable status code SHOULD be used, if the Accept header in the request indicates an unknown or unsupported format. 
The HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type status code SHOULD be used, if the Content-Type of the request is an unknown or unsupported format. 
The HTTP 400 Bad Request status code SHOULD be used, if the Accept/Content-Type headers are correct but nevertheless the status-request cannot be correctly parsed.

# Privacy Considerations

In general, the security considerations of {{RFC8995}} apply for BRSKI-PRM also. 
Further privacy aspects need to be considered for:  

* the introduction of the additional component registrar-agent 
* no transport layer security between registrar-agent and pledge  

The credential used by the registrar-agent to sign the data for the pledge should not contain any personal information.
Therefore, it is recommended to use an LDevID certificate associated with the device instead of an LDevID certificate associated with a potential service technician operating the device. This avoids revealing personal information to Registrar and MASA.

The communication between the pledge and the registrar-agent is performed over plain HTTP. 
Therefore, it is subject to disclosure by a Dolev-Yao attacker (a "oppressive observer"){{onpath}}. 
Depending on the requests and responses, the following information is disclosed.  

* Pledge product-serial-number is contained in the trigger message for the PVR and in all responses from the pledge. 
  This information reveals the identity of the devices being bootstrapped and allows deduction of products an operator is using in his environment. 
  As the communication between the pledge and the registrar-agent may be realized over wireless link, this information could be easily be eavesdropped, if the wireless interface does not apply security measures.
* Timestamp data could reveal the activation time of the device. 
* Status data of the device could reveal information about the current state of the device in the domain network. 


# Security Considerations {#sec_cons}

In general, the security considerations of {{RFC8995}} apply for BRSKI-PRM also. 
Further security aspects need to be considered for:  

* the introduction of the additional component registrar-agent 
* the reversal of the pledge communication direction (push mode, compared to BRSKI) 
* no transport layer security between registrar-agent and pledge  

TODO: other threads?

## Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Pledge

Disrupting the pledge behaviour by a DoS attack may prevent the bootstrapping of the pledge to a new domain. 

A DoS attack with a faked registrar-agent may block the bootstrapping of the pledge due to state creation on the pledge (only vouchered). Mitigation may be that the pledge does not create a state if the bootstrapping is not finished after certain time.


## Misuse of acquired PVR and PER by Registrar-Agent

A registrar-agent that uses formerly acquired PVR and PER for domain-A in domain-B can be detected by the domain registrar while PVR processing.
This requires the domain registrar to verify the "proximity-registrar-cert" field in the PVR matches its own LDevID(Reg) certificate. 
In addition, the domain registrar has to verify the association of the pledge to its domain based on the product-serial-number contained in the PVR and in the IDevID certificate of the pledge.
Moreover, the domain registrar verifies if the registrar-agent is authorized to interact with the pledge for voucher-requests and enroll-requests, based on the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate data contained in the PVR.

Misbinding of a pledge by a faked domain registrar is countered as described in BRSKI security considerations {{RFC8995}} (section 11.4).

## Misuse of Registrar-Agent Credentials {#sec_cons_reg-agt}

Concerns on misusage of an registrar-agent with a valid LDevID(RegAgt), may be addressed by utilizing short-lived certificates (e.g., valid for a day) to authenticate the registrar-agent against the domain registrar.
The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate may be acquired by a prior BRSKI run for the registrar-agent, if an IDevID is available on registrar-agent.
Alternatively, the LDevID may be acquired by a service technician from the domain PKI system in an authenticated way.

In addition it is required that the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate is valid for the complete bootstrapping phase. 
This avoids a registrar-agent could be misused to create arbitrary "agent-signed-data" objects to perform an authorized bootstrapping of a rouge pledge at a later point in time. 
As "agent-signed-data" could be dated after the validity time of the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate, due to missing trusted timestamp in the registrar-agents signature.     
To address this, the registrar SHOULD verify the certificate used to create the signature on "agent-signed-data". 
Furthermore the registrar also verifies the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate used in the TLS handshake with the registrar-agent. If both certificates are verified successfully, the registrar-agents signature can be considered as valid.  

## Misuse of mDNS to obtain list of pledges {#sec_cons_mDNS}

To discover a specific pledge a registrar-agent may request the service name in combination with the product-serial-number of a specific pledge. 
If the registrar-agent performs DNS-based Service Discovery without a specific product-serial-number, all IP addresses of pledges in the domain will be returned. 

## YANG Module Security Considerations

The enhanced voucher-request described in section {{voucher-request-prm-yang}} is bases on {{RFC8995}}, but uses a different encoding based on {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.
Therefore similar considerations as described in {{RFC8995}} section 11.7 (Security Considerations) apply.
The YANG module specified in this document defines the schema for data that is subsequently encapsulated by a JOSE signed-data Content-type as described in {{I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher}}.
As such, all of the YANG-modeled data is protected against modification.
The use of YANG to define data structures via the "yang-data" statement, is relatively
new and distinct from the traditional use of YANG to define an API accessed by network management protocols such as NETCONF {{RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{RFC8040}}.
For this reason these guidelines do not follow the template described by {{RFC8407}} section 3.7 (Security Considerations Section).

## Example Parboiled Registrar Voucher Request - RVR (from Registrar to MASA)  

The term parboiled refers to food which is partially cooked.  In [BRSKI], the term refers to a Pledge voucher-request (PVR) which has
been received by the Registrar, and then has been processed by the Registrar ("cooked"), and is now being forwarded to the MASA.

The following is an example Registrar voucher-request (RVR) sent from the Registrar to the MASA, in "General JWS JSON Serialization".
Note that the previous PVR can be seen in the payload as "prior-signed-voucher-request".

* Reworked terminology of "enrollment object", "certification object", "enrollment request object", etc., issue #27
* Reworked all message representations to align with encoding
* Included examples for several objects in section {{examples}}
* Defined new endpoint for pledge bootstrapping status inquiry, issue #35 in section {{exchanges_uc2_5}}, IANA considerations and section {{pledge_ep}}
* PoP for private key to registrar certificate included as mandatory, issues #32 and #49
* Issue #50 addressed by referring to the utilized enrollment protocol

* Issue #31, clarified that combined pledge may act as client/server for further (re)enrollment
* Issue #42, clarified that Registrar needs to verify the status responses with and ensure that they match the audit log response from the MASA, otherwise it needs drop the pledge and revoke the certificate    
* Issue #43, clarified that the pledge shall use the create time from the trigger message if the time has not been synchronized, yet.

From IETF draft 03 -> IETF draft 04:

* In deep Review by Esko Dijk lead to issues #22-#61, which are bein stepwise integrated
* Simplified YANG definition by augmenting the voucher request from RFC 8995 instead of redefining it. 
* Added explanation for terminology "endpoint" used in this document, issue #16
* Added clarification that registrar-agent may collect PVR or PER or both in one run, issue #17
* Added a statement that nonceless voucher may be accepted, issue #18
* Simplified structure in section {{sup-env}}, issue #19
* Removed join proxy in {{uc2figure}} and added explanatory text, issue #20
* Added description of pledge-CAcerts endpoint plus further handling of providing a wrapped CA certs response to the pledge in section {{exchanges_uc2_3}}; also added new required registrar endpoint (section {{exchanges_uc2_2}} and IANA considerations) for the registrar to provide a wrapped CA certs response, issue #21
* utilized defined abbreviations in the document consistently, issue #22
* Reworked text on discovery according to issue #23 to clarify scope and handling
* Added several clarifications based on review comments 

From IETF draft 02 -> IETF draft 03:

* Updated examples to state "base64encodedvalue==" for x5c occurrences
* Include link to SVG graphic as general overview
* Restructuring of section 5 to flatten hierarchy
* Enhanced requirements and motivation in {{req-sol}}
* Several editorial improvements based on review comments

  
From IETF draft 01 -> IETF draft 02:

* Issue #15 included additional signature on voucher from registrar in section {{exchanges_uc2_2}} and section {{agt_prx}}
  The verification of multiple signatures is described in section {{exchanges_uc2_3}}
  
* Included representation for General JWS JSON Serialization for examples

* Included error responses from pledge if it is not able to create a pledge-voucher request or an enrollment request in section {{exchanges_uc2_1}}

* Removed open issue regarding handling of multiple CSRs and enrollment responses during the bootstrapping as the initial target it the provisioning of a generic LDevID certificate. The defined endpoint on the pledge may also be used for management of further certificates.
 

From IETF draft 00 -> IETF draft 01:

* Issue #15 lead to the inclusion of an option for an additional signature of the registrar on the voucher received from the MASA before forwarding to the registrar-agent to support verification of POP of the registrars private key in section {{exchanges_uc2_2}} and {{exchanges_uc2_3}}.

* Based on issue #11, a new endpoint was defined for the registrar to enable delivery of the wrapped enrollment request from the pledge (in contrast to plain PKCS#10 in simple enroll).

* Decision on issue #8 to not provide an additional signature on the enrollment-response object by the registrar. As the enrollment response will only contain the generic LDevID certificate. This credential builds the base for further configuration outside the initial enrollment. 

* Decision on issue #7 to not support multiple CSRs during the bootstrapping, as based on the generic LDevID certificate the pledge may enroll for further certificates.

* Closed open issue #5 regarding verification of ietf-ztp-types usage as verified 
  via a proof-of-concept in section {#exchanges_uc2_1}. 
  
* Housekeeping: Removed already addressed open issues stated in the draft directly.

* Reworked text in from introduction to section pledge-responder-mode

* Fixed "serial-number" encoding in PVR/RVR 

* Added prior-signed-voucher-request in the parameter description of the 
  registrar-voucher-request in {{exchanges_uc2_2}}. 

* Note added in {{exchanges_uc2_2}} if sub-CAs are used, that the 
  corresponding information is to be provided to the MASA.

* Inclusion of limitation section (pledge sleeps and needs to be waked 
  up. Pledge is awake but registrar-agent is not available) (Issue #10).
  
* Assertion-type aligned with voucher in RFC8366bis, deleted related 
  open issues. (Issue #4)

* Included table for endpoints in {{pledge_ep}} for better readability.

* Included registrar authorization check for registrar-agent during 
  TLS handshake  in section {{exchanges_uc2_2}}. Also enhanced figure 
  {{exchangesfig_uc2_2}} with the authorization step on TLS level.

* Enhanced description of registrar authorization check for registrar-agent 
  based on the agent-signed-data in section {{exchanges_uc2_2}}. Also 
  enhanced figure {{exchangesfig_uc2_2}} with the authorization step 
  on pledge-voucher-request level.
 
* Changed agent-signed-cert to an array to allow for providing further 
  certificate information like the issuing CA cert for the LDevID(RegAgt) 
  certificate in case the registrar and the registrar-agent have different 
  issuing CAs in {{exchangesfig_uc2_2}} (issue #12). 
  This also required changes in the YANG module in {{voucher-request-prm-yang-module}}
  
* Addressed YANG warning (issue #1)
  
* Inclusion of examples for a trigger to create a pledge-voucher-request 
  and an enrollment-request.
  
From IETF draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 -> IETF anima-brski-prm-00:

* Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode from
  draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-03 to this document
  This required changes and adaptations in several sections to remove
  the description and references to UC1.

* Addressed feedback for voucher-request enhancements from YANG doctor
  early review in {{voucher-request-prm-yang}} as well as in the
  security considerations (formerly named ietf-async-voucher-request).

* Renamed ietf-async-voucher-request to IETF-voucher-request-prm to
  to allow better listing of voucher related extensions; aligned with
  constraint voucher (#20)

* Utilized ietf-voucher-request-async instead of ietf-voucher-request
  in voucher exchanges to utilize the enhanced voucher-request.

* Included changes from draft-ietf-netconf-sztp-csr-06 regarding the
  YANG definition of csr-types into the enrollment request exchange.

From IETF draft 02 -> IETF draft 03:

* Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
  in {{exchanges_uc2_1}} as voucher-request was
  enhanced with additional leaf.

* Included open issues in YANG model in {{uc2}} regarding assertion
  value agent-proximity and csr encapsulation using SZTP sub module).

From IETF draft 01 -> IETF draft 02:

* Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
  based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
  remaining objects with this approach in {{exchanges_uc2}} .

* Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -> registrar-agent to
  better underline agent relation.

* Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -> pledge-initiator-mode
  and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.

* Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
  changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
  and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
  higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
  are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
  extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).

* Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
  registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in {{uc2}}.

* Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
  registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
  the security considerations.

* Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
  in agent signed data (issue #37).

* Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
  to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
  (issue #1) in {{exchanges_uc2}}.

* Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
  pledge (issue #5) included in {{uc2}}.

* Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in {{exchanges_uc2}}.


From IETF draft 00 -> IETF draft 01:

* Update of scope in {{sup-env}} to include in
  which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
  for use case 2.

* Rework of use case 2 in {{uc2}} to consider the
  transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
  the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
  pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.

* First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)

* Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
  the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints do not
  result in additional /.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
  Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
  has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.

* Updated references.

* Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.


From individual version 03 -> IETF draft 00:

* Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
  the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
  new section as replacement of section 5.1.3
  in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
  cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.

* Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
  pledge-agent use case {{uc2}}, e.g. to
  accommodate distribution of CA certificates.

* Updated CMP example in to use lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
  the necessary /.well-known endpoints.

* Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
  {{req-sol}}. Shortened description of proof
  of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.

* Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
  discovery flow from {{RFC8995}} in UC1 to avoid doubling or text or
  inconsistencies.

* Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
  the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
  to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
  description, and solution description as separate sections.
  History moved to appendix.


From individual version 02 -> 03:

* Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
  self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
  underline the protection of the object with an existing
  credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
  An alternative name may be attestation object.

* Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
  case having an offsite PKI.

* Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
  self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
  tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
  in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
  introduction, the application example,and also in the
  related BRSKI-PRM call flow.

From individual version 01 -> 02:

* Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
  IDevID and LDevID.

* Update of description of architecture elements and
  changes to BRSKI in {{architecture}}.

* Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
  context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
  {{req-sol}}.


From individual version 00 -> 01:

* Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
  well as two new application use cases in {{sup-env}}.

* Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
  complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
  already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
  not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
  alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
  description in {{architecture}}.

* Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
  changes to BRSKI in {{architecture}}.

* Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
  of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in {{req-sol}}.

* New section starting with the
  mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
  boundary conditions.
